            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AMong the manifold accuſations, with which the Papiſts are wont to defame our moſt holy Religion, there is none which they oftner alledge, or more ſeriouſly endeavour to evince, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm with more plauſible arguments, than that whereby they pretend that we utterly overthrow all certainty in divine matters and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Faith it ſelf. This is the conſtant ſubject of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Diſcourſes, this is of late their only argument. To obviate therefore theſe importunate clamours, I reſolved throughly to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the whole Argument, and inquire whether there be any truth in thoſe things which many obtrude for moſt certain. Having then with ſome diligence conſidered the matter, I ſoon found, firſt that thoſe things are falſe and and frivolous, which are commonly oppoſed to us; and then that our Adverſaries themſelves are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly guilty of that crime, wherewith they aſperſe us, and can by no Arts be purged from it. For both that celebrated infallibility of the Church and of her Governours, upon which the whole Syſtem of Popiſh Faith relies, is eaſily proved to be null and feigned, and that even if it were true, it could yet produce no aſſurance of Faith, no certainty of belief. To evidence and evince all this I thought not unfit; and therefore have undertaken to demonſtrate theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I. That it is moſt falſe what is pretended with ſo much confidence, that the Church, at leaſt in the ſence by them underſtood, cannot erre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II. That granting the Church cannot erre, this her Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is of that nature, that both it ſelf labours with inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable difficulties, and can confer certainty upon nothing elſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III. That our Faith relieth upon far more firm foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that nothing is believed by us, which is not both certain in it ſelf, and ſuch as the certainty of it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known by us.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:49773:3"/>
            <p>Of theſe three Propoſitions, which may in time, God willing, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, I have now undertaken the Second, becauſe that may be comprehended in a much ſhorter Diſcourſe than the reſt. I will ſhew therefore in this Treatiſe, that the least aſſurance of thoſe things, which are believed, is wanting to the Popiſh Religion; and that all things are there doubtful, all things uncertain, and nothing firm. This altho it be moſt true in the <hi>Agenda</hi> alſo of their Religion; yet to avoid prolixity I confined my ſelf to the <hi>Credenda</hi> only, and even in theſe omitted many things, which might perhaps ſeem not inconſiderable to many. For not one or two ways only doth the Roman Religion overthrow the firmneſs of Faith: It doth it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many accounts, principally by their Doctrine of the Euchariſt, which introduces an univerſal Scepticiſm into the whole System of Chriſtian Religion: Not to ſay, that their Divines in teaching that the very Exiſtence of God is not ſo much known as believed, manifeſtly betray to Atheiſts the Cauſe of Religion. But I omit theſe things, as not properly belonging to the matter by us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. What I offer in this Diſcourſe may perhaps ſeem to ſome too much embaraſſed with Sch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>laſtick Terms and Diſputes: Nor indeed do I wholly deny it. But I deſire thoſe Perſons to conſider, whether this could poſſibly be avoided. For only to propoſe our Arguments, and not vindicate them by examining what is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them by our Adverſaries, ſeemeth to me the leaſt part of an accurate Diſputation; Which whoſoever ſhall peruſe, even with the greateſt diligence and attention, cannot nor ought not to give ſentence; becauſe they have not yet heard the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whoſe defence cannot be without injuſtice neglected. Thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences indeed are become nauſeous in this Age, and not undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly: But however they could not be juſtly paſſed by and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by us Yet in theſe I have endeavoured to propoſe them as clearly and perſpicuouſly as I could, and accommodate them to the capacity of all perſons. Whether I have gained my intent experience muſt declare.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Wherein is laid down the Deſign of this Treatiſe; and ſome things are premiſed for the better underſtanding of the whole.</head>
               <p>IT is acknowledged by all, that the perfection of that Faith, which the Schoolmen call <hi>Inform,</hi> we <hi>Historical,</hi> conſiſts in three things, that it be plenary, pure, and firm; that is, that it believeth all which God hath revealed; and that without any mixture of errour, or admittance of doubt. That the Faith of Papiſts is neither plenary nor pure many have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated: That it is not firm or unſhaken I here undertake to prove; and to ſhew, that admitting their Hypotheſes, a Papiſt cannot with a certain and firm Faith be perſwaded of the truth of any thing; not only not of thoſe Articles, which <hi>Rome</hi> hath added to the Divine Revelation, but not even of thoſe, which were truly revealed by God.</p>
               <p>For ſince Objects of Faith are inevident of themſelves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve aſſent no otherwiſe, then as it ſhall appear that they have been revealed by God; and Revelation it ſelf not a whit more evident: there is neceſſarily required one or more Rules, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by things Revealed may be diſtinguiſhed from not Revealed. We have only one ſuch Rule, the Holy Scriptures: The Papiſts many, that ſo what they want in goodneſs, they may make up in number. For to Scripture they have added Tradition, Decrees of Popes, Conſtitutions of Councils and conſent of Paſtors, not only thoſe who have ſucceſſively ruled the Church from the firſt foundation of it, but of thoſe alſo who govern at any determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate time; and laſtly the belief of the whole Church.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49773:4"/>
               <p>Now that by the means of any Rule our Faith may become firm, two things are neceſſary: Firſt that the Rule it ſelf be true, containing nothing falſe or not revealed: And then Secondly, that what we believe manifeſtly agree with this Rule. If either of theſe conditions fail; our Faith muſt be uncertain. Nor is it only requiſite, that a Papiſt be aſcertained both of the truth of the Rules of his Faith, and the conformity of what be believe unto them: But alſo that he be as firmly perſwaded of the truth of theſe things, as he is of the truth of any Article of his Faith. For ſince the Faith of Papiſts depends wholly upon theſe Rules, and is ſuſtained only by them: How can it be, that the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the truth of thoſe things, which they believe meerly for the ſake of theſe Rules, ſhould be more firm, than the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth of the Rules themſelves, or of the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of what they believe unto thoſe Rules? It being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that an Effect ſhould have more in it, than the Cauſe can give it: A Concluſion ſtronger than the Premiſes; or a Houſe firmer than the Foundations. Nor do our Adverſaries deny this. <hi>Holden</hi>

               <p>Since therefore the perſwaſion which Papiſts have of what they believe, either is, or is thought to be, Divine Faith: It hence appears that it cannot be ſolid, unleſs they be aſſured by Divine Faith, or ſome other not inferior perſwaſion, that both the Rules of their Faith are true, and that what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is entirely conformable to them. This our Adverſaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs: And becauſe ſome of them hold, that no perſwaſion is of equal certainty with Divine Faith; therefore it is neceſſary, that by Divine Faith they be aſcertained of thoſe two things, or at leaſt the firſt of them.

               <p>If the opinion of theſe Divines were received by all, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute would be the ſhorter. For then I need only prove, that none of our Adverſaries is by Divine Faith aſſured of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the foundations of his Faith: Since all other kind of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, being inferior to that of Divine Faith, would not ſuffice. But becauſe this Hypotheſis, although admitted by moſt, is denied by ſome few; and labours with inſuperable difficulties, which I will not here touch. I will not have the force of my argument rely upon it. It remains therefore to be inquired, whether our Adverſaries can boaſt of any certainty in this matter diſtinct from, and as they think, not inferior to the certainty of Divine Faith. But firſt we muſt lay down ſomewhat concerning the kinds and degrees of certainty. <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                  <note n="7" place="margin">De Juſtif. lib. 3. cap. 2.</note> makes a two fold certainty, Evident, and Obſcure; that of things in themſelves manifeſt, this of things that depend upon external proofs and teſtimonies. To the firſt kind he aſſigneth three degrees: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of firſt Principles conſtitute the firſt; Concluſions evidently drawn from theſe, the ſecond; and things perceived by ſenſe the third: That is certainty of the Intellect, of Science, and of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. To Obſcure Certainty he giveth as many degrees.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49773:5"/>The firſt is of thoſe things which are believed for Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: The ſecond of thoſe believed upon the account of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority, but that ſo illuſtrious, that it leaveth no place for doubt; the third of thoſe things which are confirmed by ſuch and ſo many arguments, as may exclude anxiety, but not diſtruſt: Or certainty of Divine Faith, which is abſolute, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Humane Faith, which is Moral, and certainty of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which is conjectural. Thus far <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whoſe diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the kinds of Certainty might be allowed: if the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a conjectural opinion, even to the loweſt degree of it, were not too improper and irrational. But to paſs by that, this rather deſerveth notice, that he hath made no mention of that kind of certainty, which is ſo famous in the Schools, as neither wholly evident, nor wholly obſcure, but mixt of both. Such have Theological Concluſions; which are deduced from two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, the one evident, the other revealed.</p>
               <p>It need not much be inquired; whether our Adverſaries have this laſt certainty of the firmneſs of the foundations of their Faith. For it is either of the ſame kind with the certainty of Faith, or of a diverſe. If of the ſame, as ſome will, then to prove, that our Adverſaries have not herein the certainty of Divine Faith, will diſprove this. If of a diverſe, as moſt think, then it is inferior to the other, and leſs firm; and conſequently not ſufficient. Beſides ſuch who think, that theſe Theological Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions founded upon a mixt certainty, are <hi>de fide,</hi> as <hi>Alphonſus a Caſtro,</hi> and <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> muſt acknowledg that their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, oppugned by ſo many and ſo great Divines of the ſame party, cannot be certain. But an incertain opinion, though true in it ſelf, cannot be the foundation of an undoubted certainty, ſuch as is that of Divine Faith. Laſtly whether this certainty be, or be not, inferior to that of Divine Faith; it can have no place here but abſurdly and prepoſterouſly. For all this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is derived from things revealed; and cannot therefore add any to things revealed. Theological Concluſions are admitted only for the ſake of thoſe revealed Propoſitions, from which they are deduced. Thoſe Propoſitions therefore cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for the ſake of theſe Concluſions, without a manifeſt and abſurd Circle.</p>
               <p>I do not remember, that any of our Adverſaries have aſſigned a Conjectural Certainty to the perſwaſion which they have of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49773:5"/>the Truth of the Rules of their Faith. And ſurely ſuch Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty would be too mean and inconſiderable for this place: Belonging to Opinion rather than Faith, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> well notes; and not excluding diſtruſt, which is abſolutely deſtructive of Divine Faith.</p>
               <p>A Moral Certainty is rarely made uſe of by our Adverſaries in this caſe; being ſuch as take place only in matters of fact, and not all thoſe neither, but only ſuch as are perceived by the ſenſes of other men, and thoſe, ſo many and ſo clearly, as take away all ſuſpicion either of fraud or errour. Whereas thoſe parts of a Papiſts belief, which have moſt need of being back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by certainty; and are ſubject to the greateſt difficulties, are matters of right; or at leaſt ſuch as fall not under the ſenſes either of himſelf or others. There are ſome things indeed, which they would have to be manifeſt by this kind of certainty, ſuch as the knowledg of a lawful Pope, or a Canonical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, what the preſent Church teacheth, or to which Society be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the notes of a true Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We muſt conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whether in theſe caſes this certainty be ſufficient. It would ſuffice indeed, if the opinions of <hi>Bagotius</hi> or <hi>Huetius</hi> were admitted: Of whom the firſt equals, the ſecond prefers Moral Certainty to Metaphyſical, and even that which is acquired by demonſtration. But few approve theſe exceſſes: Many on the contrary depreſs this certainty too low. However all agree, that it is inferior to that of Divine Faith. For which reaſon alone I might reject it, but ſhall notwithſtanding be content only then to do it, when it is falſly pretended.</p>
               <p>As for an evident certainty our Adverſaries, neither do, nor can glory in it. For if the foundations of Faith had that: No previous motion of the will by the Divine influence, no ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural aſſiſtance of grace would be neceſſary; which yet all require; and none but fools and ſtupid perſons could be disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Beſides, that thoſe things which are of poſitive right, and depend upon the free Will of God, cannot be taught by nature, but muſt be known only by Divine Revelation. But herein our Adverſaries conſent to us, as we ſhall ſee hereafter, and preſume not to boaſt of evidence in the Objects of their Belief.</p>
               <p>There remains therefore only the certainty of Divine Faith, which they can pretend to. Wherefore I ſhall chiefly conſider
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49773:6"/>that; not neglecting yet the reſt, whenſoever it can be imagined that they may be made uſe of by our Adverſaries: omitting only the certainty of Theological Concluſions, and that for the reaſons beforementioned. I ſhall now examine all the Foundations of Faith which our Adverſaries are wont to produce; beginning at the Holy Scriptures.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> That the Faith of Papiſts is not founded on Holy Scripture.</head>
               <p>THAT the Scripture is moſt certain in it ſelf, and moſt fit to ground our Faith upon is our conſtant belief and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But this cannot ſuffice our Adverſaries, unleſs they recede from their known Principles. The Scripture may be conſidered and uſed for the eſtabliſhing of our Faith two ways: Firſt as it is in it ſelf, and its own nature: and Secondly as it is confirmed, illuſtrated, and aſſiſted by the help of Tradition, and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church. That Scripture, the firſt way conſidered is not a fit foundation of our Faith, our Adverſaries not only freely confeſs but ſharply contend: maintaining that, laying aſide Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and the Church, we cannot be aſſured either that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Word of God, or conſiſts of ſuch Books and Chapters, or that they are delivered incorrupted to us, or faithfully tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or that this, or that is the ſenſe of ſuch a place. Of theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and arguments their Authors are agreed, their Books are full: that ſhould I recite but the names, much more the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the maintainers of them; I ſhould become volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
               <p>To this may be oppoſed, that this is only the opinion of the School Divines and Controverſial Writers: that there are many in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who believe the authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture independent from the judgment of the Church, and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly uſe that method of arguing againſt Atheiſts; as <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>etius</hi> in his Books of <hi>Evangelical Demonſtration,</hi> and the Anonymous Author of <hi>the Diſſertation concerning the arguments, wherewith the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49773:6"/>truth of</hi> Moſes <hi>his Writings may be demonſtrated:</hi> that ſuch as theſe may have a true and firm belief of thoſe things which Scripture plainly teacheth; which are all, that are neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
               <p>Whileſt I congratulate to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> theſe more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Proſylites, and wiſh that by a general concurrence therein they would refute my Diſſertation: I obſerve, firſt, that there are very few among them of this opinion. Secondly that it doth not appear, that even theſe few are perſwaded that their arguments ſuffice to found a Divine Faith upon the Scriptures demonſtrated by them. The Licenſers and Approvers of the aforementioned Diſſertation ſeemed to be afraid of this; while they manifeſtly diſtinguiſh a perſwaſion ariſing from thoſe arguments, from true Faith. Laſtly that it doth not appear, whether they think that they can without the authority of the Church be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe, either which are Canonical Books, or what is the ſenſe of thoſe Books. So that until they declare their mind herein, they are not by us to be disjoined from, much leſs oppoſed to the reſt.</p>
               <p>I may therefore take it for granted, that according to our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries the Faith of private men cannot relie upon the Scripture deſtitute of the aſſiſtance of Tradition: ſince it is what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt of all contend for. Now for what concerneth Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſidered the latter way, as it is fortified by the accedaneous help of Church and Tradition; I might perhaps omit the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it here; foraſmuch as neither Church nor Tradition can confer a greater degree of firmneſs upon Scripture; which that they have not themſelves, I ſhall in the proceeding of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more opportunely ſhew hereafter. However becauſe ſome few things occur not improper for this place; I ſhall very briefly ſpeak of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt then how little help there is for Scripture in Tradition, appeareth hence; that it can no otherwiſe teach what is the true ſenſe of Scripture, but by the unanimous conſent of the Fathers: which whether it be to be had in any one text of Scripture, may be much doubted. It was a hard condition therefore,<note n="1" place="margin">Nec eam un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam niſi juata unanimem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſum patrum accipiam &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretabor.</note> which Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. preſcribed, in his Profeſſion of Faith, to all which deſired admiſſion into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and which may for ever ſilence all the <hi>Roman</hi> Commentators: <hi>that they will never receive nor interpret Scripture any otherwiſe, than according to the unanimous conſent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49773:7"/>of the Fathers.</hi> Now I would fain know, how this Law can be obſerved: ſince I may confidently affirm, that there is no one place of Scripture explained the ſame way by all the Fathers. For there are many places, which none of them have touched; and none, which all have interpreted. Nor will it ſuffice to ſay, that they agree, who have interpreted it, and that the ſilence of the reſt is to be taken for conſent: as if they muſt be ſuppoſed to conſent, who were ignorant of ſuch interpretations, or dead per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps before they were made, or as if the Antients were wont ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to reject all interpretations different from their own; or theſe might not be rejected, or at leaſt others propoſed, in thoſe Books of the Fathers, which are loſt. It is not enough therefore to have the conſent of a few; unleſs we be aſſured of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the reſt. But granting that it is, it cannot be denied, that our Adverſaries can collect nothing certain out of any place of Scripture, if any one of the Antients have interpreted it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.

                  </note> maintains, that there is few places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the Holy Fathers have not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently interpreted.

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49773:7"/>
               <p>Hence the Readers may imagine, to what a ſtreight our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries would be reduced; if they were tied up to their own Laws, and allowed to urge no other places of Scripture againſt us, than what are unanimouſly interpreted by the Fathers. A Specimen hereof may be found in <hi>Launoy,</hi> where he weigheth the Texts of Scripture produced by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and ſhewing that they are diverſly explained by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, concludeth thence, that they are wholly ineffectual.</p>
               <p>That the ſenſe of Scripture cannot be learned from Tradition, hence appeareth: but neither is it taught any better by the Church. At leaſt She hath not yet taught it. For how many Decrees of the Church is there about the true ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Decrees I ſay: for not every ſimple explication or allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Text is to be lookt upon as an authentick interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; but only that which hath an Anathema affixed to the deniers of it, or diſſenters from it. Of this kind I find but four or five in the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and in thoſe of elder Councils none at all. For 1500 years the Church delivered not the ſenſe of ſo much as one place: whence may be judged, both what a faithful Interpreter She is of the Holy Scriptures! and how ſmall an aſſiſtance we are to expect from her in obtaining the true ſenſe of them.</p>

               <p>Firſt, that taking away the atteſtation of the Church, it cannot be known, that there is any Divine Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For laying aſide that, how ſhall we know, that there is any unwritten Word of God derived down to us? From Tradition? that cannot be, ſince we are now doubting, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any Tradition. From Scripture? That favours not Tradition: but if it did, it would avail nothing; ſince as we ſhew in the foregoing Chapter, Scripture according to our Adverſaries cannot obtain belief; till it be it ſelf confirmed by Tradition and the Church. Thus doth the truth of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion remain uncertain, unleſs it be ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Churches authority. <hi>Gregory a Valentia</hi>
                  <note n="2" place="margin">Sicut de authoritate ipſius Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae neceſſe per aliquam aliam certam authoritatem conſtare; ita etiam de auctoritate Traditionis, ſi ea quoque revocetur in dubium. <hi>Val. Tom. 3. diſp. 1. quaeſt. 1. punct. 7. § 12.</hi>
                  </note> well knew this, who puts Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into the ſame condition with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>neither being of authority when called in doubt, unleſs confirmed by ſome other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, granting that it may be known, that there are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Traditions, it cannot yet without the authority of the Church be known, which they are: ſo many falſe, dubious and ſuſpected Traditions being carried about; each of which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the ſame Character of Divine Authority. The teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Fathers will not help in this caſe: ſince even their judgment is dubious, and in many things it cannot eaſily be told, what was their opinion. Thus <hi>Valentia</hi>

               <p>Thus far theſe Writers: And that the reſt do not diſagree from them we ſhall ſoon be perſwaded; if we conſider, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely it is, that a greater infallibility ſhould be allowed even to an unanimous teſtimony of the Fathers; than to Pope, or Council, or both together, or the preſent Univerſal Church: All which our Adverſaries grant may erre in thoſe things which they ſimply affirm or teach, and define not to be of Faith.</p>
               <p>It ſufficeth not therefore, either that many Fathers deliver an opinion as of Faith; or that all ſhould ſimply teach it, but not affirm it to be of Faith. Now if theſe two conditions be obſerved; How few Articles of Chriſtian Faith ſhall we receive from Tradition? For the Fathers ſeldom all agree, and more rarely admoniſheth us, that what they teach, is of Faith. So that if you take away all Articles, wherein either of theſe conditions is wanting; it may well be doubted, whether any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49773:9"/>one will remain. Certainly if our Controverſial Divines ſhould ſo far make uſe of this obſervation, as to reject all teſtimonies of the Fathers produced by our Adverſaries againſt us, with which themſelves will not be obliged, that is, ſuch as are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in either of the conditions before laid down: They would be reduced to ſilence, and not have one authority left to boaſt of.</p>

               <p>If the Fathers therefore teach not Tradition; there remains only the Church, whence it can be known.

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> That the Faith of Papiſts cannot be founded even upon the Definitive Judgment of the Church.</head>
               <head type="sub">Firſt becauſe it is neither evident, nor of Faith, that the Judgment of the Church is certain.</head>
               <p>BY the name of Church, whereon our Adverſaries would have the Faith of all men to be founded, they are wont to deſign two things. Firſt that viſible Congregation of men,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49773:10"/>which conſiſts of Pope, Clergy, and Laicks; all profeſſing the ſame Faith. Secondly that part of this firſt Church, whoſe office it is to Rule the reſt, and preſcribe Laws of acting and believing to them: Whether this part be the Pope, or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. The former they call the Univerſal, the latter the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative or the Regent Church. To both they aſcribe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, but in a different way; to the firſt in believing, to the ſecond in defining, or as they chuſe to ſpeak, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing. So that whatſoever the Univerſal Church believeth, or the Repreſentative propoſeth to be believed, muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be true, and revealed by God; and the denial of it, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. We ſhall examine each in order: But firſt of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Church.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſaries believe to have been inſtituted by God a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and viſible Authority, whoſe office it ſhould be to define matters of belief and practice, infallibly determine emergent Controverſies, and judge of Hereſie. That whatſoever this power, which ſome call the <hi>Chair,</hi> others more accurately the <hi>Tribunal,</hi> defineth, propoſeth, or judgeth; may and ought to be received of all Chriſtians as an Article of Faith: and that this is the ordinary and immediate foundation of the Faith of private Chriſtians. Indeed in aſſigning this Tribunal, what and where it is, all do not agree. But that there is ſuch an one, whatſoever it is, all do contend. Whether there be ſuch an one, is a great queſtion, and may juſtly take up another Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. But now we only conſider, whether the judgment and definition of this Tribunal be ſuch, as that whoſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeth upon it, can or ought to be certain, that he doth not err, and that what he believes, is true. For it is not enough that this Tribunal be infallible, unleſs its infallibity be alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. Since if it had ſuch a priviledge, but either unknown or uncertain; he indeed, that acquieſced in its definitions, would not err, but could never be certain, that he doth not err, and might reaſonably doubt, whether he doth or no. I enquire therefore, whether our Adverſaries can be certain that the Church in defining cannot err.</p>
               <p>If the Papiſts have any certainty of the infallibility of the Church defining; it muſt be either Moral, or evident, or that of Divine Faith: For the reſt we have excluded before. But it can be none of theſe. Not Moral, for that depends upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49773:10"/>the teſtimony of anothers ſenſes: But the Infallibility of the Church cannot be perceived either by our own, or by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſenſes. Nor indeed is it here pretended to by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries: No more than Evident Certainty, which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly acknowledge they have not herein.

               <p>The whole matter therefore comes to this, whether the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church be of Faith. That it is our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, as we ſee, pretend; that it is not, I prove many ways. Firſt this ſeems to be the opinion of a man of great Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, <hi>Launoy,</hi> who every where oppugneth the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lability of the Pope, and ſheweth that the Infallibility of a Council appears to him not to be of Faith; while he ſaith<note n="7" place="margin">Quamvis certum ſit non errandi privilegium ineſſe Concilio; longè tamen certius eſt apud Theologos Eccleſiae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe. <hi>Laun.

                  </note> that <hi>although it be certain the priviledge of not erring is in a Council; yet that it is far more certain among Divines that it is in the Church:</hi> Which he would never have ſaid, if he had believed the Infallibility of a Council to be of Faith.

               <p>Beſides it is the common opinion of our Adverſaries; that nothing is of Faith, of which Diſputes are raiſed in the boſom of the Church, She being conſcious of them. Thus <hi>Holden</hi>

So that whatſoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, may be lookt upon as the ſenſe of all three Writers. Now the chief ſcope of this Book is to ſhew, that not a few opinions taught by many of their Doctors, and by us affixed to the whole Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are not of Faith, but may be ſafely denied. To the obtaining of this end they make uſe chiefly of two means, the ſilence of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the teſtimonies of Doctors of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion: and Section 15.<note n="10" place="margin">Variae ſunt hâc de re Doctorum ſententiae; quod vel ſolum ſufficit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bando id non eſſe de fide Catholicâ.</note> have theſe words, That <hi>the different judgement of the Doctors herein may aloné ſuffice to prove, that it is not of Faith.</hi> Upon this foundation proceed all thoſe Divines; who maintain that the Pope is infallible, or ſuperiour to a Council.

               <p>This opinion of our Adverſaries is grounded on a double foundation. The firſt <hi>Gillius</hi> declareth in expreſs words, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>it is not credible that ſo many learned and pious perſons ſhould

For by that connivance She ſhould at leaſt indirectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm hereſie: it being a Rule of the Canon Law,<note n="17" place="margin">Error, cui non reſiſtitur, approbatur, <hi>Diſt. 83.</hi>

               <p>If therefore I demonſtrate, that not one or two, but many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Divines, and thoſe the moſt celebrated, and by their merit preferred to the greateſt dignities in the Church, were not only ignorant of, but alſo openly denied this Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: I ſhall at the ſame time prove, that it is not of Faith.

Theſe may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to four heads. Firſt, the teſtimonies of thoſe which teach that the Pope and Council (to whom alone this Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is aſſigned) can err.

                  </note> aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>when Popes and Councils diſagree in defining; that judgment is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which is conſonant to the definitions of precedent Councils. If none of which have paſſed Sentence in this matter; then the Councils definition ſhall not be received, if the Popes be founded upon better reaſons and authorities. For that a Council can erre; as appears by that of</hi> Ariminum, <hi>the Second of</hi> Epheſus, <hi>that of</hi> Africk <hi>under</hi> Cyprian, <hi>and many others. That the Infallibility of the Univerſal Church proves not the ſame to be in a Council: Since the Univerſal Church is not truly in a Council.</hi> That in the caſe of contrary definitions by the Pope and a Council, <hi>it is not yet defined, what is to be done or obſerved.</hi> That <hi>his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion however is, that he which ſhould hold to and obſerve either part, ſhould not therefore incur the danger of Damnation although he died in the obſervation of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe manifeſtly teach that both a Pope, and Council, to whom alone active Infallibility is attributed may erre. Nor is it enough to ſay, that herein they deliver their judgments of the Pope and Council, diſagreeing one from another, and not conjunctly defining. This indeed may ſeem to be ſaid with ſome colour of Truth in <hi>Jacobatius:</hi> But as for <hi>Occam</hi> and <hi>Allia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſis,</hi> it doth by no means fit them. Nor yet doth it in the leaſt enervate the Teſtimonies of the reſt: Since whenſoever they deny infallibility to Pope or Council; they do not thereto op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the conſent of both, but either the Symbolical and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Church, as <hi>Waldenſis;</hi> or the Univerſal, as all the reſt. Beſides they deny infallibility to belong to the repreſentative Church, and to be the property of the Univerſal, whereas every one knoweth and acknowledgeth that only the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Church is in a Council. As for <hi>Jacobatius</hi> his opinion it plainly is, that obedience is then immediately to be given to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49773:13"/>the Decree of a Pope or Council when it is conſonant to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of ſome former, even particular Council, which had been received by the univerſal Church; that this obedience therefore is to be paid, not for the authority of the preſent definition, but the approbation of the Univerſal Church, which She is ſuppoſed to have given to it by a long recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But what clears the matter beyond all exception, is that <hi>Jacobatius</hi> is one of thoſe, who think the Church may fail, except one woman only: as we ſhall ſee afterwards under the third head.</p>

               <p>Thus far theſe teſtimonies, which occurred to me in a haſty ſearch. If I had time or opportunity to turn over the Writings of the XIII. XIV. and XV. Ages; I doubt not but I ſhould find many more. However any one may ſee, how utterly repugnant theſe which I have produced are to the Infallibility of Pope and Council. Yet there is no ſentence pronounced againſt theſe Writers, no mark ſet upon them, not the leaſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure inflicted on them. How can this be, if they had taught right down hereſie? Nay this opinion is not only not condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but alſo many ways approved. Firſt, in that the Defenders of it have been preferred to the greateſt dignities of the Church; ſome made Cardinals, others Preſidents of Councils, one <hi>(An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus Florontinus)</hi> Sainted and at this day Worſtripped. Which ſurely would not have been done, if he had taught Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. But what is more expreſs, and which cannot be eluded, is that <hi>Thomas Waldenſis</hi>'s work, whence he produced the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt paſſages, was ſolemnly approved by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> V. This <hi>Trithemius</hi>
                  <note n="42" place="margin">Quod <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Papa <hi>V.</hi> examinatum authoritate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicâ confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mavit. <hi>Trithem</hi> in <hi>Vald.</hi>
                  </note> aſſirms telling us that <hi>Martin V. examined this work, and confirmed it by Apoſtolical authority.</hi> The Bull of approbation alſo may be ſeen preſixed before the third Volume; with the Examination ſubjoyned, which laſted above a month; when the work being preſented to the Pope, it was by him confirmed in full Conſiſtory. So that after this ſtrict examination and ſolemn approbation to imagine hereſie is contained in this Book, will draw the Pope, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it, and the whole Church (which never oppoſed this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation) into the ſuſpicion of hereſie.</p>
               <p>I have done with the firſt argument. The ſecond ſhall be drawn from the ſilence of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> which alone proveth that they thought it not an Article of Faith; ſince they condemned not the Proteſtants on that account, although no leſs vigorouſly impugning it, than any other Article of their Church. This argument is ſo much the ſtronger, in that our
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49773:15"/>Adverſaries frequently urge the ſilence of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to prove Articles, by us objected to them, not to be of Faith. So <hi>Veronus,</hi> and the <hi>Valemburgian</hi> Brethren in the book above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. So the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> in that Famous Book, which hath illuded ſo many. If they reaſoned well herein; why may not we uſe the ſame Arguments? And then the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church cannot be of Faith, becauſe wholly pretermitted by the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Council.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that it is not of Faith may be proved hence, that no ſoundation of ſuch a Faith can be alledged. For if any were, it muſt be either Scripture, or Tradition, or ſome decree of the Ruling Church, or the conſent of the Univerſal Church. That Scripture and Tradition cannot be produced in this Caſe, we have already demonſtrated, for this reaſon eſpecially, becauſe the certainty of both depends upon the teſtimony of the Church.

               </p>
               <p>I wiſh the Jeſuit in writing this had firſt objected to himſelf our whole Argument. For that is drawn not only from the impoſſibility of knowing, according to our Adverſaries, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Scripture or Tradition without being firſt aſſured of the infallibility of the Church; but alſo from hence, that they teach it cannot be known which are the Canonical books, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther received by us uncorrupted, or faithfully Tranſlated, and is the true ſenſe of them, without the ſame previous aſſurance. If he had objected all this to himſelf; he muſt either have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from all the reſt of their Divines, and denied their ſo much boaſted of arguments, or have yellded herein. Yet let

                  </gap> and abſurd. For of that we are aſſured no otherwiſe then by Faith, and conſequently it cannot be a foundation to Faith. Now this being taken away, the other Arguments of the Truth of Scripture and Tradition according to the Jeſuits argumentation become fallible, and ſo no ſit foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for infallible Faith. Beſides I would know whether this acquired Faith carrieth with it indubitable Truth, and be of the ſame certainty with. Divine or infuſed faith, or at leaſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to found Divine Faith upon. For if it be not, our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment returns: If it be, why may we not have without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Churches authority a Divine Faith of thoſe things, which Scripture, or if you will, Tradition alſo, clearly and plainly teach, at leaſt as clearly, as they are thought to teach that infallibility of the Church.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Amicus</hi> hath a reſerve for this. He pretends<note n="43" place="margin">Ibid. num. 49.</note> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the human Arguments of the Truth of Scripture and Tradition be ſelf evident avd ſufficient to create a Divine Faith; yet that we are forbidden by God to believe them with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith; till his Vicar the Pope ſhall have confirmed them. A miſerable refuge, which lyeth open to a thouſand inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies. For to omit asking where this prohibition of God is to be found; not to urge that hereby all their Arguments drawn from the nature of the thing concerning the uncerainty of any revealed Article without the ſupervenient Authority of the Church, are wholly deſtroyed; not to ſay, that hereby the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie is turned from matter of Right into matter of Fact, and become a meer enquiry, whether God hath made any ſuch prohibition: Laying aſide I ſay all theſe things, I will inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this one Obſervation. It is not here enquired, whether Scripture and Tradition propoſed by any other than the Pope oblige us to aſſent or not; but only whether any one, either obliged or not obliged, can receive them howſoever propoſed and thence build his Faith upon them. If he can, then our Argument returns; and we may alſo believe with Divine Faith what we find taught in Scripture. If he cannot, I would fain know which way then Papiſts can admit Scripture and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from them learn the Infallibity of the Church; ſince <hi>Amicus</hi> had before denied that it could be Learned, or ought to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49773:16"/>be believed for the teſtimony of Scripture and Tradition, as infallibly propoſed by the Church.</p>
               <p>It is manifeſt therefore, the belief of the Inſallibility of the Church cannot reſt on Scripture or Tradition. But neither can it on the judgment of the Ruling Church. For beſides that no ſuch judgment is produced; if it were, it would be fruitleſs.

Our Adverſaries ſay, that private perſons ought to believe the active infallibility of the Ruling Church; becauſe they ſeeit believed by the Univerſal Church. But why doth the Univerſal Church believe it: truly for no other reaſon, but becauſe She do believe it.

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> That it is uncertian, what are thoſe Decrees of the Church, whereon Faith may relie.</head>
               <p>WHAT I ſaid will be more manifeſt to him, who ſhall conſider; that to make the Decrees of the Church a fit foundation for our Faith, it is not ſufficient to know that the Church in defining cannot err; unleſs alſo we know, what are thoſe definitions of the Church, which are placed beyond all danger of errour. For our Adverſaries all acknowledge, that the Church doth not always, nor in all things enjoy this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Infallibility; but in many things may be miſtaken, as in deſining Philoſophical queſtions: and in general whatſoever belongeth not to Religion. Some add Controverſies of Fact; others Canonization of Saints; many all thoſe things, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though belonging to Faith, are not yet propoſed as of Faith, but only ſimply affirmed, or brought for the illuſtrating and confirming of ſome other matter. Since the Church therefore may be miſtaken in ſo many things: we ought to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, what thoſe Decrees are, wherein Shecannot err.</p>
               <p>That this notwithſtanding is moſt uncertain, two things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. Firſt that it appears not, what are the conditions, what the Character and Notes of a firm and valid Decree. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that although this ſhould appear, it would not yet be known what are thoſe particular Decrees, which have theſe Characters. The firſt again is manifeſt by two reaſons: firſt in that it is uncertain whether theſe exceptions, wherewith the infallibility of the Church is limited, be all lawful; and then no leſs uncertain whether they be all, which can and ought to be aſſigned. For if both theſe things be not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known; we ſhall continually doubt, whether we do not for ſome unjuſt exception undeſervedly reject ſome Decree of the Church, that ought to be obeyed; and received ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which for ſome juſt exception not yet aſſigned ought to be rejected.</p>
               <p>But both on the contrary are uncertain. The firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49773:17"/>the lawfulneſs of the conditions already aſſigned is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Adverſaries themſelves do ſo irreconciliably differ in aſſigning them. Whatſoever one layeth down, ſome other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth: So that nothing certain can be had thence. Nor can it be ſaid theſe conditions are ſelf evident, or of Faith. For what evidence is that which eſcapes the knowledge of ſo many Learned men? And our Adverſaries grant, as we ſaw before, that nothing can be of Faith, whereof Catholick Divines diſpute unregarded by the Church. Beſides if it be of Faith, it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. But where is this revelation? In Scripture? Nothing either is or can be produced thence. In Tradition? That will afford perhaps two or three Teſtimonies of the Antients, but which reſpect only one condition (that of excluding Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Fact) and are themſelves liable to many exceptions. But granting they are not, what ſhall become of the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions aſſigned, of no leſs moment: Or what will two or three Teſtimonies avail, wherein their Authors affirm not what they write to be of Faith: Nor will the Regent Church give us any help herein. For She hath defined nothing in this matter; or if ſhe had, it would be wholly vain. For it would ſtill be enquired, whether that Definition were of Faith; and ſo in <hi>infinitum.</hi> As for the Univerſal Church, She can have no place here, as well for the reaſons abovementioned, as becauſe her diſſent rather than conſent is to he ſhewed herein.</p>
               <p>There is no way therefore left, but to recur to Experience. They will ſay they have obſerved the Church to erre, when ſhe undertook to define in caſes excluded by their exceptions; and that theſe exceptions therefore muſt neceſſarily be applied to thoſe places of Scripture, which attribute infallibility to the Church. But then they will give us juſt reaſon to reply, that if experience giveth us a right to reject that ſenſe of Scripture, which the words ſeem to imply, meerly becauſe it is repugnant to our Obſervations, and ſubſtitute another more congruous to them! Then we may moſt juſtly reject that ſenſe of thoſe Words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> which our Adverſaries aſſix to them, as contrary to the experience of all mankind, and aſſign ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfectly accommodated both to reaſon and experience. Beſides there is nothing againſt which our Adverſaries more ſharply contend, than to judge and examine the Definitions of the Church by dumb and dead Rules, ſuch as Scripture and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49773:17"/>Tradition are: yet this very thing is done by thoſe men, who thence conclude the Church to be fallible in certain caſes, becauſe they have obſerved her to have been formerly miſtaken in them. For this can be done no otherwiſe than by examining the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Church, either by Scripture, or Tradition.</p>
               <p>Again, if experience giveth them a right to limit the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church by their exceptions; why may not we chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the ſame priviledge, and aſſign our exceptions likewiſe. We then lay down only that one, formerly propoſed by <hi>Cuſanus,</hi> which if admitted by our Adverſaries, will ſoon put an end to all controverſies, that is, that the Church never preſume to define any thing but according to the Holy Scriptures, leaving unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided all things, wherein they are either ſilent or obſcure. And ſo all our Controverſies are reduced to this one point, whether this exception is to be added to thoſe which our Adverſaries have aſſigned. As often therefore as they oppoſe to us the judgment of the Church, we may with reaſon reject it, till they can ſhew, that our exception is unjuſt, which they will never be able to do. On the contrary we can demonſtrance the equity of it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and ſhew that the Church hath erred, as often as She ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved not this exception. But let it be rejected. Who cantell, Whether no other is to be added? Certainly if the obſervation of the paſt Errours of the Church have given occaſion to theſe Writers to form theſe exceptions; the obſervation of future er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors will likewiſe produce new exceptions. Nay who will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that nothing already paſt hath eſcaped the notice of theſe Obſervers, whence other exceptions might have been framed?</p>
               <p>And hence alſo appears what I undertook to prove in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, that although we were aſſured the exceptions are lawful and juſtly aſſigned; we cannot be certain they are all that are ſo, and whether others are not yet to be added. For ſince the exceptions are formed only from experience; if the Authors of them made not a juſt obſervation of all the paſt errours of the Church, or had not in their eye all poſſible future errors of a different nature; there may be other exceptions, no leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and momentous, to be aſſigned. And how ſhall we be at laſt aſcertained of the requiſite diligence, ſagacity, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of theſe Obſervers? I ſhall illuſtrate all by a famous example. One of the cheif exceptions, whereby the Papal power is limited, is that all thoſe Decrees are excluded, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49773:18"/>were not for ſome ſpace of time affixed to the doors of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Church and the Apoſtolick Chancery, and ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged by the Popes Meſſengers in the wonted places. This exception was made about an hundred years ſince meerly to ſerve a turn; when they could by no other means clude the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the Proteſtants againſt the Papal Infallibility drawn from Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. his Bull, whereby he re-called <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. his Edition of the Bible, and Preface prefixed to it. Then it was they forged this exception pretending that <hi>Sixtus</hi> his Bull, although printed and prefixed to his Bibles, had not been ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly publiſhed by the Meſſengers. An exception, which had been never dreamt of, had not <hi>Sixtus</hi> erred; as appeareth hence, that the precedent Writers <hi>Cajetan, Canus,</hi> and <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> make no mention of it, whereas of the ſubſequent Writers few forget it. Nor is there any doubt, but that if any Pope hereafter ſhould commit ſome other miſtake, which might wound his pretended Infallibility; ſome other Exception would be framed to ſalve his honour.</p>
               <p>If therefore our Adverſaries, as we have proved, cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know what are the conditions and characters of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Decrees of the Church, they muſt neceſſarily be ignorant, which Decrees may be ſecurely believed and obeyed. But granting they might be certain herein, and taking away all theſe ſcruples, they will be yet for ever uncertain which Decrees have, which want theſe conditions. For what will it avail to know that the Church, may err in matters Philoſophical, or of Fact, or which are not propoſed as of Faith; if we be uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what are Philoſophical matters, what of Fact, and what propoſed as of Faith? Yet that all theſe kinds of things are yet uncertain, will be eaſily evinced. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſince the School Divines have ſo intermingled <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Philoſophy with Divinity, nothing is more difficult than exactly to diſtinguiſh them. Whence it frequently happens, that what one accounts meerly Philoſophical, another eſteems matter of Divinity. So in the year 1666. when a certain Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine<note n="1" place="margin">
                     <hi>Apud</hi> Launoi Epiſt. part 5. Epiſt. 2. <hi>ad</hi> Berruer.</note> at <hi>Paris</hi> had propoſed theſe and ſuch like <hi>Theſes</hi> to be publickly diſputed of, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>any knowledge in the Father was abſolutely ſufficient to beget the Son; ſo that if the Father had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood but any one object, ſuppoſe a Lilly, he muſt be thereby ſuppoſed to have begotten the Son, that if both together had loved but any one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49773:18"/>as a Roſe, yet would they thereby have ſpirated the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> That <hi>the unſpeakable torment of Devils conſists in this, that by hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical union the Devil is become fire, and fire become the Devil.</hi> Theſe and the like Theſes the propoſer maintained to be Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical. <hi>Launoy</hi> contends they are Philoſophical; others think, perhaps more truly, that they are fooliſh and prophane. The Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> defined the accidents in the Euchariſt to remain deſtitute of any ſubject. The <hi>Carteſians</hi> deny this, and value not the definition, pretending that it is about a matter Philoſophical. Others thereupon accuſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of hereſie. <hi>Copernicus</hi> and <hi>Galilaeus</hi> their Syſteme of the world were condemned at <hi>Rome.</hi> Some thereupon dare not embrace it, though otherwiſe inclined to believe it. Others more bold contend it is purely a matter of Philoſophy. See therefore many learned and wiſe men divided about the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt exception. And if ſo, how ſhall more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant perſons be able rightly to diſtinguiſh them, and thence cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to know, to which of the Churches Decrees they are to give a ſteadfaſt, and to which a dubious Faith?</p>
               <p>The ſame is the caſe of the ſecond Exception. Many of our Adverſaries deny the Church to be infallible in queſtions of Fact. In the mean while they differ about determining, what are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, and what of right. To know what is the ſenſe of a late Writer, many account a queſtion of Fact. <hi>Eſtrix</hi>
                  <note n="2" place="margin">Eſtr. Diat. <hi>de ſapientiâ</hi> &amp;c. aſſert.</note> on the contrary contends it belong to right.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of the third Exception. That excludes from the rank of infallible all Decrees not propoſed as of Faith. But what thoſe Decrees are, doth not appear. So the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> for example, defined that the body of Chriſt exiſts under the Bread <hi>by vertue of the words,</hi> but the Blood <hi>not by vertue of the words, but by concomitance.</hi> No anathema being inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe, that think otherwiſe. Hence aroſe a queſtion, whether this diſtinction were of Faith. Some in <hi>Vaſquez</hi>
                  <note n="3" place="margin">Vaſq. <hi>in</hi> 3. diſp. 185. cap. 2.</note> hold the negative: himſelf largely endeavours to prove the affirmative. This might be further confirmed with innumerabe inſtances. But I chuſe rather to take notice of ſomewhat more remarkable. The Church in defining hath in theſe latter Ages been wont to make uſe of words, which might rather conceal than declare her opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and from which the moſt ſagacious perſons ſhould not collect her meaning. For example one of the notes, whereby we know,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49773:19"/>whether a definition be by the Church propoſed as of Faith, is the excommunication of the Deniers of it, yet it ſometimes happens the Church would not have that be thought to be of Faith, the Deniers whereof She excommunicates. So the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>

Now none but Heretical propoſitions hurt the Faith, and conſequently if the Church be infallible only in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which ſhe propoſeth as of Faith, when ſhe condemneth theſe mixed propoſitions, her judgment is infallible only in reſpect of the Heretical ones. The reſt may with ſafety and truth be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. It is of inſinite concern therefore in the direction of our Faith; that theſe propoſitions ſhould be diſtributed into their ſeveral Claſſes, and the particular cenſure ſpecified in each of them. But that is very rarely done. The propoſitions are all huddled up together: And we are only told in general, that ſome of them are Heretical, others Erroneus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But when that would not do, he conſulted Cardinal <hi>Toletus,</hi> whom the Pope had ſent to <hi>Lovain,</hi> to ſee the Bull put in execution; and Learned from him that the Popes had condemned ſome of thoſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, only becauſe they were too ſharply worded. Now what a rare help doth the Church afford in declaring to every one what he ſhould believe when the ſenſe of her own decrees can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known without conſulting her moſt intimate Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, ſuch as <hi>Canus</hi> and <hi>Toletus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further it may very well be, that he which knoweth the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular propoſitions condemned of Hereſie, may be ignorant wherein the Hereſie conſiſts. For the ſame propoſition may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of many ſenſes, whereof ſome may be true, others falſe, ſome Heretical, others not. If the Church had any care of the truth: She ought accurately to diſtinguiſh theſe ſences, and tell us which may be admitted, and which ought to be exploded. But nothing of this is done. Rather <hi>Pius</hi> V. and <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. declaring that ſome of <hi>Baius</hi> his Propoſitions are in ſome ſenſe maintainable but in rigour heretical, tell us neither what is that harmleſs ſenſe, which may be defended, nor that pernicious He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, which ought to be avoided.</p>
               <p>But nothing evinceth this more clearly, than what lately hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened upon occaſion of the Janſeniſt Doctrine. Five Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were taken out of <hi>Janſenius</hi> his <hi>Auguſtinus,</hi> and by ſome French Biſhops ſent to be examined by the Pope. Others were preſent for <hi>Janſenius,</hi> who pleaded the Propoſitions were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of divers ſenſes, ſome true, ſome falſe; and earneſtly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it might be ſpecified in which ſenſe each Propoſition were approved or condemned. That requeſt being ſtiſly denied by the Roman Conſiſtory, who were reſolved to condemn them
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49773:20"/>in the groſs: The Janſeniſts diſtinguiſhed Three Senſes of each Propoſition, and placing the different ſenſes in Three Columns offered them to the Examiners, deſiring they would admoniſh which of all thoſe ſenſes the Cenſure aimed at. But neither ſo could they obtain their End. Only afterwards when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie grew hot, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. declared the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were condemned in the ſenſe intended by the Author. The Author had been now dead, before his Book was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, much leſs condemned. And ſo while the Popes pretended to condemn the Authors ſenſe; they ſaid nothing elſe but that they condemned a ſenſe; which neither they would, nor any body elſe could tell, what it was. And to this day it is diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among them, what is that Heretical ſenſe intended by the Author and condemned by the Popes.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Third Exception. I might add another, which not a few of our Adverſaries produce. For they require, that the Church proceed maturely, diligently, and Canonically in her judgment: Which certainly few or none can know. But becauſe the conſideration of this would take up too much time. I ſhall omit it: Having already ſufficiently evinced, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more uncertain, than to know what are thoſe Decrees of the Church, which may be ſecurely believed; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that Faith cannot be founded on them.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49773:20"/>this thing is really uncertain, as I ſhall prove. There are three opinions concerning it among our Adverſaries. For this Supream and Infallible power is by moſt aſſigned to the Pope alone, by almoſt all the French and ſome few more to a Council alone, and laſtly to Pope and Council together by ſome very few, ſo few, that I could never find one that expreſly aſſerted this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and but two or three that obſcurely inſinuate it.</p>
               <p>I begin with the Pope; and affirm, that unleſs his Infallibility be of Faith, his Decrees cannot be the foundation of Faith. No other certainty will here ſuffice, for as for Moral and Self evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, here is not the leaſt ſhadow of them; and that of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Concluſions I before excluded.

Now this obſtinacy is judged of, partly by the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Propoſition of the Truth oppoſed to Hereſie, partly by the internal diſpoſition of mind. Now becauſe the latter is known to God alone, and all truths are not ſufficiently propoſed to all; therefore thoſe of whom <hi>Raynaudus</hi> ſpeaks do wiſely in laying down that limitation of <hi>material Hereſie.</hi> But this <hi>Salvo</hi> will not ſerve the Learned disbelievers of the Papal infallibility. For ſince it is as clearly revealed to them, as it is to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of it: Either thoſe are rank Hereticks, whom a ſufficient Propoſition will not convince; or theſe fools, who aſſent to an opinion inſufficiently propoſed.</p>
               <p>Thus indeed theſe Writers: But others are of a contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, as <hi>Bellarmine, Vaſquez, Tannerus, Duval,</hi> the <hi>Valemburgii, Gab.

For if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be an Article of Faith, of which their Divines freely diſpute unregarded by the Church: This certainly cannot be; whoſe Truth hath been and is to this day fiercely diſputed of among them, even by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Confeſſion from the time of the Council of <hi>Constance;</hi> the Church all this while inflicting no cenſure on either party. Beſides if the Infallibility of the Pope be of Faith; it will then be Hereſie to deny it, as we ſaw ſome before aſſerting. <hi>Hadrianus Florentius</hi> therefore was an Heretick, (who affirms<note n="11" place="margin">Certum eſt, quod poſſit (Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex) errare, etiam in iis quae tangunt fidem, Hereſin per ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem vel Deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talem aſſerendo plures enim fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt Pontifices <hi>Rom.</hi> heretici. <hi>Hadr.</hi> in <hi>Dictat.</hi> in <hi>4.

                  <hi>the Pope can err even in thoſe things which concern Faith by aſſerting Hereſie by his determination or decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and that many Popes have been Hereticks.</hi>) and the Church will be a favoureſs of Hereſie in that She afterwards promoted <hi>Hadrian</hi> to the Popedom without firſt requiring of him an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration of his Hereſie.</p>
               <p>Again if this opinion be Heretical, the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> will
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49773:21"/>be heretical, that defined it and vigorouſly maintained it: The <hi>Sorbon</hi> and <hi>Gallican</hi> Clergy hereticks, that teach it: the Pope a favourer of hereſie, who daily conferreth Abbies, Biſhopricks, and Cardinals Hats on notorious Hereticks, giveth them places in Councils, and maintains Communion with them: the whole Latin Church will have been divided in point of Faith, and part infected with hereſie, part with the Communion of hereticks, for many Ages, from the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> according to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> but even from the time of <hi>Firmilian</hi> (or the middle of the third Century) according to <hi>Lupus;</hi> who aſſigns <hi>Firmilian</hi> to be the firſt oppoſer of Papal Infallibility, and makes St. <hi>Baſil</hi> to have been his Succeſſor in opinion, as well as in the See of <hi>Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> that thenceforward this Hereſie got ground among the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> inſomuch as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> condemned by the Popes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the Council at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> hoping their ſentence might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be reverſed by the Greek Biſhops, as not allowing the Popes Infallibility. If ſo, then this diſſention is very ancient in the Church; which if it toucheth Faith, then a peſtilent Hereſie hath for many Ages been connived at by the Church and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. But whatſoever becomes of <hi>Lupus</hi> his Calculation, certain it is this diſſention hath continued from the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> ſo that if it be concerning a matter of Faith, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath all this while wanted that glorious Character of Unity of Faith, which She ſo much boaſts of.</p>

               <p>ANother ſcruple next ariſeth, no leſs weighty than the former. For granting we may be aſſured of the Infallibility of the Pope, it is ſtill to be inquired which be thoſe Decrees of his that are infallibly true.

Many things are by them required, and beſides thoſe before mentioned two other conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> Diligence of the Pope in well examining the queſtion to be defined, and obſervation of the due ſolemnities in publiſhing the definition. For the firſt, they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49773:22"/>require that he diligently conſult Scripture and Tradition, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs himſelf by Prayers to God, and omit nothing, which may aſſiſt him in finding out the Truth. So <hi>Tapperus</hi>

               <p>But who can aſſure us, that this requiſite diligence was always uſed? Or as often as a Papal decree comes forth, are we to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend our aſſent, till we be aſcertained that nothing requiſite was omitted by the Pope?

               <p>Another very evident Example of this is afforded by the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. his Bibles, which alone might evince three things, that the Popes are not always ſufficiently diligent in their Definitions, that they can err in any Decrees, and that it is not known when the requiſite Solemnities are obſerved in the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which was my ſecond Argument.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49773:23"/>frivolous impertinence,</hi>

                  <hi>and ſhameful nonſenſe.</hi> That <hi>promulgation ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing to the Popes Infallibility; nor addeth any truth or falſehood to the definition, but ſuppoſeth it in them. For if it be falſe the Promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation will not make it true, although it be publiſhed by a thouſand Meſſengers, and affixed to St.</hi> Peters <hi>doors to all Eternity:</hi> That Sixtus <hi>in defining that, for which his Bull was abrogated, did plainly err; and that</hi> Clement <hi>in abrogating his Bull and ſuppreſſing his Edition ought himſelf to have believed this, at leaſt gave others occaſion to believe it.</hi> Thus <hi>Launoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might add it hath hitherto been believed that this Infallibility doth proceed from the Holy Ghoſt. But when ſhould the Holy Ghoſt confer it? Surely, if ever, while the queſtion is diſcuſſing and defining. Whereas now when the Pope hath done all that lay in his power, and nothing remains but only ſome petty circumſtances of promulgation to be performed by ſervile and illiterate Meſſengers; then only, and not till then, doth this Infallibility exert it ſelf; which makes the Pope fallible, and the Meſſengers infallible. For the firſt may pronounce ſomewhat falſe, the latter nothing but what is true. But paſſing by all theſe things, ſuppoſe this excuſe well grounded. Yet have I obtained, what was to prove that there may be ſometime wanting in the Pope that diligence which is neceſſary to define well. For this conſiſts not in the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Promulgation, but in examining the queſtion, inquiring the truth, and weighing the reaſons. What if after all it be not duly publiſhed by Meſſengers: That concerns not my argument, nor hinders the precedent negligence of the Pope.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if without theſe ſolemnities of Promulgation no Bulls be obligatory, the authority of the Decrees of all antient Popes may be juſtly doubted of. For who can aſſure us that all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were then obſerved, when it is the height of folly to think they were ſo much as known. Either theſe therefore are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or the ancient Decretals are all void. But ſuppoſe they are neceſſary: That they are not wanting to this Bull of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the ſubſcriptions of the Meſſengers do teſtifie. I know it is pretended that they were added by anticipation only to haſten the Edition. But that ſerveth my purpoſe as well. For muſt every one, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Bull, ſuſpend his obedience, till he ſhall ride poſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſult the Regiſtres? And hence appears the uncertainty of the ſecond condition required to the Infallibility of any Papal Decree. For if the Teſtimony of the Bull it ſelf be ſometimes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49773:23"/>falſe, and we be forced to pick up the Truth from flying reports; how ſhall we be ever aſſured, that the Decree was duly Promulged?</p>
               <p>One thing more we may obſerve, that even by <hi>Tanners</hi> confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome reported, that the Decree of <hi>Sixtus</hi> was really affixed in the due places, and taken down after his death. This <hi>Compton</hi>

Sect. 5.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo dares not deny, but leaves it to the Reader to be believed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by him. But if the Bull was not taken down, till <hi>Sixtus</hi> died; then <hi>Sixtus</hi> erred as long as he lived, and promoted errour as far as in him lay; and what is the chief of all, uſed not the neceſſary diligence to avoid errour.</p>

               <p>WE are not yet got rid of our doubts and perplexities. Thoſe which we have already mentioned, are external, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the ſenſes, if not of all, yet at leaſt of ſome.

                  </note> excuſe here will not avail, <hi>That</hi> Marcellinus <hi>taught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the Faith, was no Heretick or Infidel, but in external act, for fear of death.</hi> For (to paſs by the accuſation of the Synod of <hi>St<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueſſa,</hi> that he did it for the love of mony) even this demonſtrates what I was to prove, that a Pope may be induced by ſome pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of mind, as ſear or covetouſneſs, to violate his Conſcience, and betray the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liberius</hi> comes next, who after he had bravely a while reſiſted the threats of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> either weared out with the hardſhip of his Exile, or moved with the deſire of recovering his See poſſeſſed by <hi>Faelix;</hi> ſubſcribed to the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie, and the ſentence againſt <hi>Athanaſius, Bellarmine</hi> pleads much in his excuſe: The ſum of which is this, That <hi>Liberius</hi> his fault conſiſted only in condemning <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and communicating with Hereticks; that himſelf neither taught Hereſie, nor was an Heretick but in external action; laſtly that the Confeſſion, which he ſubſcribed, was orthodox, although the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> were wanting; and that according to <hi>Sozomen</hi> before his departure from <hi>Sirmium</hi> he publiſhed a Confeſſion, wherein he condemned the <hi>Heterouſians.</hi> But this anſwer of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſufficient. For 1. Whereas he pretends <hi>Liberius</hi> was an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick only in external act, that no leſs ſerves our purpoſe, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting that a Pope may be wrought by his paſſions to pronounce in matters of Faith againſt his own knowledg and judgment. 2. If he condemned <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> it was not becauſe he was by the falſe accuſations of the <hi>Arians</hi> induced to believe <hi>Athanaſius</hi> guilty, but only that he might free himſelf from the miſeries of baniſhment, and the fears of death: As <hi>Athanaſius</hi>

                  <hi>Peter</hi> neither ſaid, writ, nor decreed any thing. What more unlike than theſe two!

               <p>The laſt example is that of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. who having called

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> That it is not certain, whether he who calls himſelf the <hi>Pope,</hi> and is commonly accounted the <hi>Pope,</hi> be really ſuch.</head>
               <p>THere remains yet another inextricable doubt. For ſuppoſe we have overcome all the precedent difficulties, and found ſome relief for ſo many uncertainties: It is yet to be inquired, whether he which makes the Decrees, and propoſeth them to be obſerved by the Church, be the true and lawful Pope, as he is commonly eſteemed. For while this be doubtful; we may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubt whether his Decrees be obligatory. Now this matter may by many wayes become uncertain. As firſt it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that two or more do at the ſame time contend for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy; all of which have their ſeveral Partiſans, by whom they are accounted the lawful Popes. Many ſuch Schiſms have been in the Church, whereof one continued near 50 years. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true Pope was then ſo difficult: that <hi>Duvall</hi> and <hi>Maimburg</hi> obſerve two Oecumenical Councils, thoſe of <hi>Piſa</hi> and <hi>Conſtance,</hi> dared not to examine and define the matter; but thought it more prudent to depoſe all of them, and create a new One. How then ſhall private men be able to know, what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils themſelves could not find out? But neither then alſo, when One only claims the Papacy, and poſſeſſeth the Throne, doth it certainly appear, whether he be a lawful Pope: and that for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons.</p>
               <p>For in the firſt place if he be an Heretick, a Schiſmatick, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel, or an Atheiſt; he cannot ſurely be Pope. For as <hi>Turre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cremata</hi> ſaith well, <hi>how ſhall he be Head of the Church, who is no Member of the Church? Gregory à Valentia</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Val. tom. 3. diſp. 3. quaeſt. 15. punct. 3.</note>, and many with him, diſtinguiſh between an open Heretick or Infidel, and a ſecret one, aſſerting the firſt cannot be a Member of the Church or Pope, the latter may, for this reaſon chiefly, becauſe otherwiſe Confuſions and Dangers could not be avoided in the Church, if the actions of ſecret Hereticks and Schiſmaticks were <hi>ipſo facto</hi> invalid. Yet he acknowledgeth in the ſame place, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion is held by the greateſt Men in the Church of <hi>Rome, Aquinas, Turrecremata, Sylveſter</hi> (who affirms this to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49773:27"/>Opinion of all the Doctors) <hi>Paludanus, Auguſtinus Anconita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lricus, Cajetanus</hi> (at leaſt as to what concerns Hereſy) and <hi>Alphonſus à Caſtro.</hi> Whence this at leaſt is gathered, that <hi>Valentia</hi>'s Opinion is not certain, and the contrary not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: which is ſufficient for my purpoſe. For whether true on falſe, matters little in this caſe, provided nothing be certain on either ſide.</p>
               <p>Further thoſe who imagine the Pope forfeits not his Dignity, unleſs he be an open Heretick, agree not among themſelves. Some think him <hi>ipſo facto</hi> deprived without expecting any ſentence, ſome not till ſentence is pronounced. But thſe latter herein ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully betray the Popes Superiority to a Council, which they had undertaken to defend. For if a Pope fallen into Hereſy ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Dignity, till he be judged and deprived by a Council; the Council will be thereby Superiour to a true and undoubted Pope. Again how ſhall a Council condemn a Pope for Hereſie; if it cannot certainly define what is Hereſie; which according to theſe Divines cannot be done by a Council deſtitute of its Head, ſuch as that Council muſt neceſſarily be, which depoſeth the Pope for Hereſy. But of that in another place. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> although far more wary and circumſpect than <hi>Duvall,</hi> thought the Pope by manifeſt Hereſie fell <hi>ipſo facto</hi> from his Dignity; ſo that by a Council he is not ſo much depoſed, as pronounced to be depoſed. But ſince that is called manifeſt Hereſie, which is declared by ſome outward ſign as Words or Writing, nor doth it matter whether it be manifeſt to few or many; there will alwayes remain a doubt, whether he who is accounted Orthodox, be not in his mind a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, Infidel, or Atheiſt, and hath not revealed his Hereſie to ſome of his intimate Friends and Confidents. For that once ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he cannot be Pope. Nay <hi>Bannes</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Bann. in 22. quaeſt. 11. art. 4.</note> aſſerts, That <hi>he which ſpeaks out his Hereſy by words, although no man hears him, is not to be accounted a meer mental Heretick, but doth thereby incurr the Sentence of Excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you ask, whether there were ever any ſuch Popes: The moſt noble <hi>Jo. Fr. Picus Mirandula</hi>

                  </note> ſhall anſwer for me. <hi>We remember,</hi> ſaith <hi>he, another Pope ſo eſteemed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, whom good Men believed neither was nor could
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49773:27"/>be Pope, as he which believed no God, and exceeded the utmoſt pitch of infidelity; as his Simony and infinite wickedneſſes did alſo teſtifie. And it is affirmed he confeſſed to ſome of his Domeſticks, he believed no God; even then when he ſat in the Papal Chair. And I have heard of another Pope, who affirmed to one of his Confidents, that he did not believe the immortality of the Soul.</hi> To this we may add the expreſs Confeſſion of <hi>Coſter</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Fatemur fieri poſſe, ut Petri ſucceſſor idola colat, apud ſe fortè de fide non rectè ſentiat, adeo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It may be that the reputed Pope be for ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known reaſon incapable of that Dignity; as if he be not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or hath not received Holy Orders. For the Council of <hi>Florence</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Janua Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum.</note> hath defined Baptiſm to be <hi>the door to the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> and in the third Book of the Decretals, <hi>Tit.</hi> 43. it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded both by the Council of <hi>Compeign</hi> and by <hi>Innocent</hi> III. that if a Presbyter whom all accounted to have been baptized, ſhall afterwards appear not to have been baptized, he be firſt bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then anew ordained. Wherefore if he be either not baptized, or not ordained, he cannot be Pope. But either or both may eaſily happen, ſince to the validity of thoſe, as well as other Sacraments, our Adverſaries require the intention of him that confers the Sacrament, which can be known to God alone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It may be that he who is commonly accounted Pope, may be unduly created, and for ſome Canonical impediment, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt or occult, be uncapable of the Papacy. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith <hi>Lupus</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Neque enim gravis canonica perſonae vitia per Papalem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectionem ſanan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Lup. Schol. ad Conc. VIII. p. 1354.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>all Canonical irregularities of the perſon are not taken away by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Popedom.</hi> For which reaſon he there obſerveth <hi>Pope</hi> Conſtantine <hi>was juſtly depoſed, as being of a Lay-man immediately made Pope; whereby he became irregular by the Canon of</hi> Sardica: <hi>and that, as is affirmed by approved Authors,</hi> Clement VII. <hi>dared not call a General Council againſt the Lutherans; becauſe being a Baſtard, he feared to be declared irregular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, He who is elected Pope, may be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and ſo not capable of that Dignity. So <hi>Picus Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Pic. Theor. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> tells us of <hi>a learned and ſober man in his time, and he a Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitary of the Church; who gave it for his opinion, that the then Pope was no Pope, becauſe he had exerciſed the Office of Pope, before he had been elected by two parts of the Cardinals; whereas the Canons provide that ſuch a man ſhall be ſo far from being Pope, that he ſhall be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49773:28"/>uncapable of that Dignity, as lying under an Anathema.</hi> For the like cauſe it is reported the Jeſuits were reſolved not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. for Pope, if he had condemned <hi>Molina,</hi> as he intended, becauſe of ſome ſlaw in his Election. It is an eſtabliſhed Rule of the Roman Conclave, That none be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed duly elected, but who hath two third parts of the Cardinals Votes: Cardinal <hi>Sanſeverino</hi> had gained them, and thereby of right became Pope. But while they were giving their Votes in the Chappel, the diſſenting Cardinals crowded in, diſturbed thoſe who were taking the Votes, and perſwaded one of the other Cardinals to withdraw his Vote: whereby <hi>Sanſeverino,</hi> although duly elected, miſſed the Chair; and <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> conſecrated, who took upon him the Name of <hi>Clement</hi> VIII.</p>
               <p>But theſe perhaps are very rare inſtances. Thoſe which follow are more frequent. It often happens, that the Election is not free, but extorted by force, threats, promiſes, bribes, factions, and the like arts. In which caſes the Popes themſelves have pronounced the Election to be null and irregular, and the elect Perſon an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipope and Apoſtate. So <hi>Nicolas</hi> II.<note n="h" place="margin">Plat. in Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col. II.</note> decreed in a <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, <hi>That all Elections procured by money, or favour, or popular tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Non Apoſtolicus, ſed Apoſtaticus.</note> 
                  <hi>or military violence, ſhould be null and void; and the Elect Pope accounted not Apoſtolical but Apoſtatical, to be anathematized by the whole Church as a Robber, and by any means depoſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Julius</hi> II.<note n="i" place="margin">Sicut de verâ &amp; indubitatâ haereſi.

                  </note> is much more rigorous, who with the conſent of the Cardinals decreed and defined, <hi>That Simony was true and undoubted Hereſie,</hi> and that <hi>in whatſoever Election that intervened by giving, receiving, or promiſing of money, or any other goods or Benefices, the Election ſhould be</hi> ipſo facto <hi>void; and the Elect, although he had the concurrent Votes of two thirds of, or even all the Cardinals, ſhould be no Pope, but made for ever uncapable of that or any other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiastical Dignity, and be held and deteſted by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as an Apoſtate, Simoniack, Haereſiarch, Magician, Heathen and Publican:</hi> and that <hi>the perſon thus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacally elected ſhall never become regular, by any ſubſequent inthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization, or preſcription of time, or even the adoration or obedience of all the Cardinals.</hi> Thus theſe Popes, truly and wiſely. For Chriſt had ſaid long before<note n="k" place="margin">John x. 1.</note>, <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, He that entreth not by the door into the ſheepfold, but climbeth up ſome other
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49773:28"/>way, the ſame is a thief and a robber.</hi> And the Apoſtle after him<note n="l" place="margin">Hebr. v. 4.</note>, <hi>No man taketh this honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</hi> Whoſoever therefore obtain the Popedom by evil arts; and enter not by the Door, but leap into the Chair by wickedneſs, are no lawful Paſtors, but Thieves, and Robbers, and ravening Wolves.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, Were there ever ſuch Popes? I anſwer: why not? Certainly the very Conſtitutions of <hi>Nicolas,</hi> and <hi>Julius,</hi> and others, which might be added, prove it is poſſible, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate it hath ſometimes happened. For thoſe things are not wont to be forbidden, which cannot be performed: and it is a received Maxim, That <hi>good Laws ariſe from bad Actions.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ex malis mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas bonae leges.</note> But we want not frequent Examples.

               <p>Our Adverſaries are here brought into great ſtreights. <hi>Duval</hi>

                  </note> confeſſeth, it is a great difficulty, and what hath excited no ſmall ſtirs in ſome Univerſities. To ſolve this, they take diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ways. Some deny it can ever happen, that an unlawful Pope ſhould poſſeſs the Chair; and that it is of Faith to believe every particular Pope lawful. So <hi>Suarez, Valentia, Arriaga, Raynaudus, Caspenſis, Martinonus, Rhodius,</hi> and others cited by them: and with reaſon. For if this be not of Faith; no Faith can be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their Decrees, as they invincibly argue. But on the other ſide, how can that be of Faith, which ſo many Examples prove to be falſe? Or on what foundation ſhall this Divine Faith be placed? <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Martinonus</hi> anſwer upon the reception of the Church: and 'tis worth obſerving how they confirm that. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if it ſhould be once granted,</hi> ſaith <hi>Suarez</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Si talis poſſet ſemel dari error in univerſali Eccleſiâ; nunquam eſſet verum illam habere certam &amp; infallibilem regulam vivam fidei ſibi loquentem Chriſti nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. <hi>Suar. de fide, diſp. 10. Sect. 5.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>that an errour of this nature can happen in the univerſal Church; it can be no ways true, that ſhe hath a certain and infallible living Rule of Faith ſpeaking to her in Chriſt's Name.</hi> The ſame ſaith <hi>Martinonus</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mart. de fide, diſp. 5. Sect. 6.</hi> Nam is error aequiparatur errori in fide—muitò intolerabiliùs eſſet errare in vivâ fidei regulâ. <hi>Iidem ibid.</hi>
                  </note>. Both add, that this errour would be equal to an errour in Faith: <hi>For,</hi> ſay they, <hi>if it be an intolerable errour in the Church, when the whole Church believeth a Book to be Canonical, which is not; although that be but a dead rule of Faith; it would be much more intolerable to err about the living rule of Faith.</hi> That they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſoundly, cannot be denied. For it is no leſs repugnant to abſolute Infallibility to err about the living than about the dead rule. But this being admitted, I ſhall much more eaſily prove the Church can err about the dead Rule, than <hi>Suarez,</hi> that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err about the living. That it cannot err about the dead Rule our Adverſaries can never prove: that it can about the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, I will demonſtrate. If ever any Pope was unlawful and irregular, ſurely <hi>Vigilius</hi> was. Yet he was owned and eſteemed as lawful Pope by the fifth General Council, and by the whole World. Although he were baniſhed, impriſoned, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vilified by the Emperour for the refuſing to condemn the <hi>Tria Capitula,</hi> and afterwards excommunicated by the Weſtern Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops for doing it; yet was he never denied to be true and lawful Pope. So in the ninth and tenth Ages thoſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Popes were, by <hi>Baronius</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">At, quod mirandum eſt, iſti (Pontifices) licèt tales fuerint, tamen eo honore &amp; reverenitâ fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deles omnes proſequebantur Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manam Eccl. ut quemcunque in eâ ſedentem audirent nomine te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Pontificem, eundem, mirum dictu! nullâ habitâ diſcuſſione ejus ingreſsûs, eum ut Petrum co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerent. <hi>Bar. ad an. 897.</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49773:31"/>whomſoever they heard did preſide in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>although indeed but a nominal Pope, never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the lawfulneſs of his Election, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected no otherwiſe than St.</hi> Peter <hi>himſelf.</hi> In a word, all thoſe whom I mentioned before, were generally obeyed by the Church. The Church therefore can err in this matter. But ſee how <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> and the reſt, by pretending the contrary, have deſtroyed their own darling Opinion. For if it be of Faith, that a Pope acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the whole Church, is a lawful one; then <hi>Stephen, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> and <hi>Sergius,</hi> who condemned <hi>Formoſus,</hi> and annulled his Acts as not being lawful Pope, erred; and ſo farewel all Papal Infallibility. For they erred in the Faith; if it be of Faith that <hi>Formoſus</hi> was lawful Pope, as it muſt be according to theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; ſince <hi>Formoſus,</hi> while he lived, was acknowledged and obeyed by the univerſal Church; whereas theſe three Popes his Succeſſours defined, that he was no lawful Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duval</hi> perhaps was aware of theſe inconveniencies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took another method. He maintains it matters nothing, whether he which poſſeſſeth the Popedom, be true Pope or no; and that his Decrees will not be at all the leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. <hi>We affirm,</hi> ſaith he<note n="g" place="margin">Dicimus talem Pontificem pro vero creditum nunquam erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum—ne in Eccleſiam falſum pro vero obtrudatur, nunquam eum Deus errare ſinet, &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ſecundum legem communem &amp; ordinariam. <hi>Duvall. de po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. Pont. par. 2. qu. 5.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>that ſuch a Pope e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed for true, can never err. For God, leſt falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood be obtruded upon his Church for truth, will never permit him to err, and that according to the common and ordinary Law: becauſe the Pope is not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for the Church.</hi> But there is nothing ſolid in all this. For firſt his reaſon is vain. For if the Pope be not for himſelf, but for the Church; no more are any other Governours of the Church. Shall therefore whatſoever they do be valid, although they be neither baptized nor ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? To think ſo, <hi>Suarez</hi> calls Hereſie, nor will <hi>Duval</hi> allow it. Yet allow it he muſt, or elſe part with his Argument. Secondly, this is directly contrary to <hi>Julius</hi> II. his Decree. For <hi>Duval</hi> would have a Simoniack or irregular Pope to be obeyed and heard. <hi>Julius</hi> commands him to be looked upon as an Hereſiarch and Magician, to be diſobeyed, deprived, and driven out of his See. Thirdly, if we conſult Scripture, that forbids us to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to theſe Invaders of Church Offices. For our Saviour, after he had ſaid that thoſe which enter into the ſheepfold any other
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49773:31"/>way, than by the door, are Thieves and Robbers: adds<note n="h" place="margin">John x. 5.</note>, <hi>And a ſtranger will they</hi> (the ſheep) <hi>not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of Strangers.</hi> And in another place<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. vii. 15.</note>, <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets, which come to you in ſheeps cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves.</hi> Now <hi>Simoniacks</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers</hi> of Eccleſiaſtical Offices are theſe Thieves and Robbers, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Wolves.</p>
               <p>Now as for reaſon, that can never teach us, that we owe the ſame reverence to unlawful, as to lawful Popes. For contrarily in the Civil Government every man is bound even to diſobey a Tyrant and Uſurper, who drives out the lawful Prince.

               </p>
               <p>But to return to our Argument; what more incredible, than that an Atheiſt, Infidel, and profane perſon ſhould be infallible? Who would not wonder at a Pope pronouncing and deriding Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles at the ſame time? Infallible and ignorant of his Infallibility? Teaching with certainty what himſelf thinks to be falſe? Surely if things be ſo; an irregular and uſurping Pope ought not in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be depoſed: Since his Infallibility, as well as that of any lawful Pope, will ſerve to direct the Faithful, and confound Hereticks; and his Depoſition cannot be attempted without the danger of Schiſm. Laſtly I would know, whether when an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful poſſeſſeth the Throne of a lawful Pope; Infallibility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to both, or only to the firſt. If to both, then in vain doth God diſpenſe ſo great a gift to the injured Pope, whom no Body acknowledgeth as ſuch. If only to the firſt, then the Priviledges of an Intruder will be more and greater, than thoſe of a lawful Pope; and Uſurpation will confer, what Canonical Election can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. To theſe add the Arguments, which <hi>Suarez</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Suar. de fide diſp. 10. § 6.</note> produceth againſt this Anſwer: As, <hi>That it incurreth the ſame difficulties it is brought to ſolve. For it is not more certain that a reputed Pope hath the Priviledge of Infallibility, than that he is a lawful Pope: Since both depend upon the common belief of the Church, and neither is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. Again, if he be only a Nominal Pope, he may be alſo only a Nominal Prieſt, and ſo cannot give Abſolution, hath therefore no right to all the Priviledges granted by Chriſt to St.</hi> Peter, <hi>becauſe no ſhare in the Power delegated to S.</hi> Peter <hi>in thoſe words,</hi> Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou ſhalt bind on Earth, <hi>&amp;c. Farther that Anſwer is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in aſſigning to the reputed Pope an inſeparable property of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> (Infallibility) <hi>and yet denying him to be Pope, that is, truly ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is manifeſt therefore, that this Anſwer is plainly falſe: But let it be true. What ſtill if it ſhall be uncertain? It will be in the end the ſame thing; and we ſhall as eaſily obtain our deſign. For if I may doubt whether he be lawful Pope that poſſeſſeth the Chair; and alſo whether an unlawful Pope enjoyeth the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Infallibility: I may then juſtly doubt, whether I ought to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49773:32"/>aſſent to the Decree of every ſingle Pope, and can never be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of it. That the firſt is uncertain I have already ſhewed. That the latter is not certain, Our Adverſaries will not deny. For if any, it muſt be the certainty of Faith; which <hi>Duvall</hi> will never grant, who denies even the Infallibility of a lawful Pope to be of Faith. If any one yet ſhall diſſent from <hi>Duvall,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that it is of Faith: he may be convinced by the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which we produced againſt the reſt. He may be asked where God revealed it, or the Church defined it. He may be told that Defenders of the contrary Opinion were never yet accuſed or condemned of Hereſie. Laſtly, He may be put in mind of <hi>Stephen, Romanus,</hi> and <hi>Sergius,</hi> who declaring <hi>Formoſus</hi> to have been an unlawful Pope, did alſo annull his Decrees. But I need not inſiſt upon refuting that, which no man maintains. So that we may conclude there is no certainty to be had in this matter, and therefore that Faith cannot ſafely rely on the Pope's Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49773:33"/>conſider <hi>Duval</hi>'s argument. And firſt, <hi>Duval</hi> hereby is not conſonant to himſelf. For if the Pope's Decrees be not of Faith, till received by the Church, then the Pope alone is not a Rule of Faith, but an aggregate of Pope and Church together: when as <hi>Duval</hi> in another place<note n="b" place="margin">Id. in <hi>22.</hi> pag. <hi>62.</hi>
                  </note> teaches there are five Rules of Faith, the Church Scripture, Tradition, Council, and Pope; whereof every one is ſo independent and ſufficient, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it ſhall propoſe is moſt firmly to be believed: not to ſay that hereby the perfections of a Rule of Faith will appear much more eminently in the Church than in the Pope; ſince the Church can direct our Faith without the Pope, but not the Pope without the Church; whereas <hi>Duval</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>215.</hi>
                  </note> teaches the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Herein therefore he is neither conſonant to himſelf, nor to the other Patrons of Papal Infallibility, while he denies obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be due to the Popes Decrees, till they be received and confirmed by the Church: this being very near the opinion of the Sorboniſts, thoſe great Enemies of the Popes Infallibility. For the Faculty of Divinity<note n="d" place="margin">Facultatis dogma non eſt quòd ſummus Pontifex nullo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedente Eccleſiae conſenſu ſit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilis.</note> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their opinion in the year 1663. in theſe words; <hi>It is not the judgment of this Faculty, that the Pope is infallible without the conſent of the Church.</hi> And the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> in the year 1682. determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note n="e" place="margin">In quaeſtionibus fidei praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puas.

For if ſo, whether fallible or infallible, it ſignifies not: in matter of practice it will be the ſame, and aſſent will be equally denied to the Popes Decrees, until they ſhall have been admitted by the Church.</p>
               <p>In the next place this Anſwer accuſeth of raſhneſs and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the far greater part of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which without expecting the approbation of the univerſal Church, blindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Papal Decrees, howſoever yet uncertain. But that is of leſs moment. This I would gladly know, whether the Church, whoſe reception makes the Papal Decrees to become of Faith, ought to receive them without any precedent examination, or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49773:33"/>not till ſhe hath accurately compared them with the Word of God. If the latter, then we have no definition, on which Faith can rely. For I dare confidently affirm, there is none, which the Church hath thus examined and approved. Few undergo that labour: moſt blindly follow the Dictates of the Pope. Not to ſay, that this is intirely repugnant to that profound ſubmiſſion, wherewith the Decrees of the Head of the Church ought to be received: or that according to this Principle the Pope ought, together with his Decree, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſeveral Biſhops the reaſons of it; ſince without the knowledge of theſe they cannot be duly examined; or that the Pope is highly unjuſt, who without being firſt certified of their univerſal approbation, excommunicates and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the contemners of them: I will only urge, that by this means the ſupreme Power is tranſlated from the Pope to the Church, as which paſſeth the laſt and peremptory Sentence, not only on things to be believed, but even on the Decrees of the Popes themſelves. How this will agree with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our preſent Adverſaries; let them ſee to it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>Raynaudus,</hi> and the Author<note n="f" place="margin">De Lib. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. Gall. <hi>lib. 7. cap. 17.</hi>
                  </note> of the Treatiſe <hi>of the Liberties of the Gallican Church</hi> think far otherwiſe: of whom the latter beſtows a whole Chapter to prove this very Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, That the Papal Decrees are not therefore to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe confirmed by the Churches conſent; but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſented to by the Church, becauſe antecedently infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</p>
               <p>But if the Pope's Decrees are to be received by the Church with a blind aſſent, and without any previous examination. I do not ſee of what weight ſuch a reception can be; which according to this ſuppoſal muſt be granted to falſe Decrees, as well as true. Beſides, ſuch reception would not differ from Divine Faith, ſuch as is given to the moſt authentick Revelations: and ſo this opinion would be repugnant to it ſelf. For it ſuppoſeth Faith is not to be yielded to the Papal Decrees antecedently to the Churches reception; and yet requires the Church to receive them with a blind aſſent, that is, with Faith.</p>

For then many things would become of Faith, which are by no means ſuch; as the Aſſumption of the B. Virgin, which no Chriſtian doubts of, and yet none believe to be of Faith.</hi> He might have added other Examples: which we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce hereafter.</p>
               <p>It may be yet asked, Whether this Approbation of the Church required by <hi>Duvall,</hi> ought to be expreſs, that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope's Decrees ought to be poſitively received by all, before they become Infallible: for if ſo, there are few or no Decrees, which have been thus received, certainly none, whoſe Reception of this kind is or can be manifeſtly known: or whether a negative Reception will ſuffice, and ſo thoſe Decrees become certain, which are oppoſed by none. But neither can this be certainly known, until we be aſſured, that the Decree is taken notice of by all the faithful. Whereas how many Papal Decrees are there, which are unknown to the greateſt part of Chriſtendom? And no wonder: ſince St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf was ignorant of that <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon, which forbad him to be aſſociated in the Biſhoprick to <hi>Valerius</hi> yet alive. But that which is chiefly to be herein regarded, is that the certainty of this ſufficiency of the negative Reception of the Church can never be demonſtrated, and without that we are ſtill at a loſs.</p>
               <p>This conſideration alſo is of no ſmall moment: That if it be lawful to deny Credit and Obedience to the Popes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, before it ſhall be known they have been received by the Univerſal Church: hereby a wide gate is opened to Schiſms and Diſſenſions. For then every contentious or capricious perſon may contemn and hinder the Execution of the moſt juſt Decrees; and ſo put an end to the Authority of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>THUS have we diſpatched the three firſt Foundations of a Papiſt's Faith. The fourth ſucceeds, <hi>viz.</hi> an Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Council; which may be conſidered two ways, either
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49773:35"/>as disjoyned from the Pope, and deſtitute of his conſent; or as confirmed by it. The <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> hold the Infallibility of it the firſt way conſidered, The Monarchical Divines only the ſecond. But that I need not diſpute ſeparately againſt the <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi> appears for two reaſons: Firſt, Becauſe their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is eaſily confuted. For we need oppoſe to them no more than this, that the Infallibility of ſuch a Council is not certain, at leaſt it is not of Faith, as we before demonſtrated it ought to be. For the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> can never prove this to be revealed by God. Scripture ſaith nothing at all of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, eſpecially Oecumenical. They flee indeed to Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But they cannot produce any Teſtimonies of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that ſay this is of Faith; not any evident Decrees of Councils; not the conſent of the Univerſal Church, for the greateſt part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church thinks otherwiſe. Beſides, the Oppoſition it hath met with among many Divines of the Church undeniably proves it not to be of Faith. For if the diſſent of a few <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> can cauſe the Infallibility of the Pope not to be of Faith; certainly the oppoſition of a far greater number of Monarchical Divines will produce the ſame Effect, as to the Infallibility of a Council without the Pope. Secondly, Becauſe it may be confuted with the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherewith I ſhall prove that the definitions of Pope and Council conſenting together are no firm Foundation for our Faith. For if both together ſuffice not, a Council with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Pope will never be ſufficient: Since the conſent of the Pope may poſſibly add ſome firmneſs to the Decrees of a Council, but moſt certainly can take none from them.</p>
               <p>To ſuperſede therefore any further Diſpute of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let us enquire whether the Faith of our Adverſaries can rely on the Decrees of Pope and Council conſpiring together. This many of them imagine. <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Bell. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. lib. 2. cap. 2.</note> and <hi>Duvall</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Duvall de Pot. Pont. part. 2. qu. 6.</note>, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there is no doubt of it among them; that it is unanimouſly taught by their Divines, and therefore is of Faith. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny both. For although the Monarchical Divines are of this Opinion, yet the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> diſſent: who maintain indeed the Infallibility of a General Council, whether agreeing or diſagreeing with the Pope; but allow not this Prerogative to every Council, but only to a Council truly Oecumenical, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49773:35"/>conſtituted, Canonically proceeding, and wholly free. The Monarchical Divines acknowledge the neceſſity of thoſe Conditions, yet differ from the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> two ſeveral wayes. Firſt, In that they interpret theſe Conditions differently; as we ſhall ſee hereafter. Secondly, In that whether theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions be preſent, they would have judged from the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent confirmation of the Pope: which the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> will by no means allow, but require the knowledge of it to be had ſome other way. Hence many Councils which the Pope hath pronounced to be both lawful and Oecumenical, the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> will not acknowledge either for lawful or Oecumenical; as that of <hi>Lyons</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> IV. that of <hi>Florence,</hi> and the <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> X. others which the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> admit, and the Monarchiſts reject, as thoſe of <hi>Piſa, Conſtance</hi> (at leaſt as to the firſt Seſſions) and <hi>Baſil.</hi> So <hi>Bellarmin</hi> rejecting ſome antient Councils, as thoſe of <hi>Sirmium, Ariminum, Milan,</hi> and the ſecond of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> on pretence that they were not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Pope, is ſaid by <hi>Richerius</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Richer. apol. pro Gerſ. axiom. 22.</note> to triſle in aſſigning for the cauſe that which is not ſuch: Since, as he affirms, theſe Councils were not rejected, becauſe not approved by the Pope, but becauſe wanting the requiſite Liberty. Not to ſay, that the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> reject ſome Councils, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pope was preſent, oppreſſing and over-awing their Liberty. It is manifeſt therefore that the conſent of our Adverſaries about the Infallibility of Councils confirmed by the Pope, conſiſts only in words, and is not real; and that by a General Council the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> underſtand one thing, the <hi>Monarchiſts</hi> another. The thing it ſelf therefore cannot be of Faith; ſince by the received Doctrine of that Church nothing can be ſo, but what is unanimouſly acknowledged and taught by Catholick Divines.</p>
               <p>But to make the whole matter more evident, I will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate two things. Firſt, That this appears not to be of Faith from other Arguments beſide the diſſent of the <hi>Sorbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> and <hi>Monarchiſts.</hi> Secondly, That although it were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in general, there are ſome Infallible Councils, yet it can never be known that any particular Council is ſo. This was demonſtrated above, although under other terms, when we proved that the active Infallibility of the Church is not of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49773:36"/>Faith: and what I juſt now produced, confirms it not a little. To which may be added, That the Infallibility of Pope and Council together cannot be of Faith, becauſe the Infallibility of neither ſeparately is ſo. For I would ask, why that alone ſhould be of Faith: whether becauſe that only is true, or that alone revealed, or that only known to be revealed. Not the firſt: for then the whole <hi>Latin</hi> Church would have erred. For there is not, at leaſt, not known to be, any, who do not attribute Infallibility either to the Pope alone, or a Council alone. Not the ſecond: For then the ſame inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience would follow, ſince there are none but what hold the Infallibility of one of the two to have been revealed. Not the third; For who can ever imagine, that God would give Infallibility to Pope or Council, and yet not reveal it ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as that it might be believed with Divine Faith. For he can have given it for no other end, than that it might be to Chriſtians the Rule of Believing, which it cannot be, as we before proved, unleſs it be it ſelf of Faith.</p>
               <p>To this may perhaps be oppoſed, that the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Pope or Council ſeparately wants not Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only the Definition of the Church propoſing it. But if ſo, then the ſo much boaſted of Wiſdom and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Holy Ghoſt muſt be wanting in the Church, which would not make this Revelation by her Definition to be of Faith, and thereby have left to the faithful no other living Rule of Faith than the Pope and Counſel conſenting together, which for the known difficulties of calling Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils cannot be perhaps had and applied once in an Age; whereas the Infallibility of the Pope, if defined to be of Faith, would be an apt and eaſie Rule, ready to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted upon all occaſions. But in truth this Infallibility of Pope and Council united is no where expreſly revealed by God, or openly defined by the Church. For many places of Scripture, and Decrees of Councils are indeed alledged for the Infallibility of each ſeparately, but not one for that of both conjunctly. None certainly will deny this; if the Opinion of <hi>Albertus Pighius,</hi> and <hi>Fr. à Victoria</hi> be true: Of whom the firſt by the confeſſion of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Bell. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. lib. 1 cap. 3.</note> thought the inſtitution of Councils plainly human, and found out by

                  </note> hath theſe words; <hi>A whole Council can do nothing, which each Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop might not by his own power do of himſelf: whence this power is not in the Council immediately by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, but by the will of the Biſhops.</hi> That this opinion is at leaſt probable, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. For no mention of General Councils is to be found in Scripture, none in the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Writers of the three firſt Ages, to whom they were wholly unknown. If this opinion ſhould be true, that ſo much Infallibility would vaniſh into ſmoak. For who could aſſure us, that God had annexed ſo great a priviledge to an humane Inſtitution? at leaſt it could never be of Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wanting Divine revelation. I know this opinion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> but ſo ſoftly, that he doth not explode it as abſurd and intolerable; nor ſay the contrary is of Faith, but only more probable. From whence I argue, That if the Divine inſtitution of Councils be only more probable, then their humane inſtitution is probable: at leaſt neither opinion exceedeth probability, and ſo neither can be of Faith.</p>

                  </note>: <hi>Such a Council ought in the firſt place to be truly General.</hi> This therefore is firſt to be inquired, whether any Council obtruded on us for a Rule of Faith, be General. Now I aſſert two things: I. That there were never yet any ſuch. II. That even if there had been, it would be yet uncertain, which were ſuch. The firſt I will prove in this, the ſecond in the following Chapter.</p>
               <p>That a Council be truly Oecumenical, one of theſe things may be thought neceſſary: either that all the Biſhops of the World be preſent, or at leaſt thoſe who may ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the abſent. For who can otherwiſe imagine, that a few Biſhops ſhould authoritatively impoſe Laws upon the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number not inferiour in Piety and Learning, at leaſt not neceſſarily inferiour. Certainly by the conſent of all, one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual hath no authority over another: and a few meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, do not by their conjunction obtain a right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Laws to the greater number, although disjoyned in place, as a Learned man<note n="d" place="margin">Thornd. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig. Eccleſ. cap. 22.</note> hath well obſerved. We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſarily recur to one of theſe conditions. Yet although even the firſt ſhould happen, which cannot be without infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite difficulty, I am not obliged to grant the whole Church to be repreſented in that Aſſembly. For not to ſay, that would ſuppoſe that blind obedience which is forbidden by the Scripture; it may happen that in a Dioceſs the Biſhop be Heretical, and the inferiour Clergy Orthodox. In which caſe the Biſhop cannot repreſent the belief of his Church nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>de facto</hi> nor <hi>de jure,</hi> unleſs we will ſay his Church was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49773:37"/>bound to follow him in his Hereſie. But I will not inſiſt on this. Suppoſe ſuch an Aſſembly to repreſent the whole Church. Yet this cannot be denied, that ſuch an Aſſembly never was, nor any Council in which ſo much as the twentieth part of the Epiſcopal Colledge were preſent. And if ſuch a Council were never held formerly, when the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World was ſubject to one Emperour: it cannot be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for in this preſent ſtate of Chriſtendom divided into ſo many Kingdoms and Commonwealths.</p>
               <p>Laying aſide therefore this, let us conſider the ſecond way of holding a General Council. Thoſe who are preſent in a Council can no otherwiſe repreſent abſent perſons, than if they come in their name, and by their command, which may be two ways. Firſt, if they be expreſly and by name delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as if Provincial Synods ſhould be held every where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the General, and Delegates there choſen for the whole Province. Or ſecondly, if omitting all this, every Biſhop abſenting himſelf, ſhould for that very reaſon be thought ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly and interpretatively to transfer his Vote and Authority on thoſe which go to the Council, <hi>Richerius</hi> and <hi>Holden</hi> ſeem to favour the firſt way, <hi>Salmeron</hi> the latter. For <hi>Richerius</hi>

               <p>However it be, the firſt way of holding General Councils is not obſerved by our Adverſaries. For immediately upon the Summons every Biſhop, who intends to be preſent, ſets forward without expecting the Delegation of their Compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Biſhops. Nay rather both the Hiſtorians of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> Father <hi>Paul,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Palavicini,</hi> relate that when the Viceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> would have had four Biſhops of that Kingdom choſen and ſent to the Council in the name of all the reſt; the Pope took it very ill, and moſt ſeverely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it to be done. Which I queſtion not to be the reaſon, why <hi>Canus</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in aſſigning the conditions of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, never mention this. This expreſs and formal Delegation therefore is not neceſſary to conſtitute a General Council; unleſs they deny the <hi>Tridentine</hi> and other Councils, in which it was not uſed, to be General. But neither is it valid, if it were uſed. For Biſhops may be delegated either with an abſolute and unlimited Power of giving their Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as they pleaſe; or reſtrained to certain Rules of Voting on this or that ſide. The firſt way, though tolerable in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral affairs, the ſucceſs of which is of no great moment, yet is not to be endured in matters of Faith and eternal Salvation. For ſuppoſe the Delegates vote Hereſie; ſhall the Delegators be bound to confirm their Suffrages? The ſecond way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legating deſtroys the liberty of the Council. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Biſhops would by this means be no Judges of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies propoſed; and all diſputation or examination of the Queſtion in hand would be wholly vain.</p>
               <p>The firſt way therefore of Repreſentation is uſeleſs. Let us now conſider the ſecond. I affirm that the abſent Biſhops can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to have committed their ſuffrages to the preſent.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49773:38"/>For firſt, Although this may with ſome colour be ſaid of thoſe which have been lawfully and ſufficiently ſummoned; yet it cannot be applied to them, who either are not ſummoned at all, or not by him who hath the lawful Authority to do it. Who this is, is yet undetermined. Beſides, what if the abſent Biſhops ſhall openly proteſt they will not be obliged by what the others ſhall decree, as the <hi>French</hi> did at <hi>Trent;</hi> Shall they be alſo ſuppoſed to have tacitely aſſented? But to ſhew the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this pretence more clearly, I will prove that tacit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation, which in other caſes may be allowed, to have here no place. Firſt, it doth not appear what is the peculiar Office to be performed by the Biſhops in a Council. <hi>Holden</hi> makes them only Witneſſes of revealed Truths: Others rather think them to be Judges. But Judges they cannot be unleſs alſo Witneſſes. For how ſhall they define an Opinion to have been revealed or not; unleſs they know it to be ſo, and be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Revelation, or at leaſt Tradition. Yet 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Proxies in witneſſing are not wont to be allowed; or if they be, that a tacit delegation will not ſuffice. I add, if it were a matter of more external Diſcipline, or what concerns only the Biſhops themſelves; thoſe who abſent themſelves might perhaps be ſuppoſed to quit their right, and ſubmit themſelves to the judgment of the reſt which meet in the Council. But to imagine ſuch a thing in a matter of Faith and Truth is moſt abſurd. Shall thoſe Biſhops, who might have born Witneſs to the Truth, be thought to have forfeited or deſerted their right; only becauſe either voluntarily or by force they were abſent from the Council? If this were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; errour would ſoon triumph over Truth, and Faith over Hereſie. For our Adverſaries confeſs, and Experience hath often proved, That the major part of Biſhops in a Council may favour Hereſie. For ſuppoſe the heretical Biſhops nearer to the place of the Council, or ſupported by the favour of the ſecular Prince, or mightily zealous in the propagation of their Errour, all which advantages <hi>Arianiſme</hi> formerly enjoyed in the Eaſt. If to theſe be added the right of repreſenting abſent Biſhops, they may eſtabliſh Hereſie in the Church for ever, and oblige the abſent Biſhops for a puniſhment of their negligence to ſubſcribe to erroneous Definitions of Faith. Laſtly, If the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49773:39"/>abſent Biſhops tacitely delegate their ſuffrages to the preſent; there is no number of Biſhops ſo ſmall, which may not conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a General Council, nay, although they be all of one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; (provided the Summons were directed to all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces) as being interpretatively inveſted with the Authority of all the abſent Biſhops. Which yet is not allowed by our Adverſaries: and <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

               <p>THAT there is no truly Oecumenical Councils, I have proved in the precedent Chapter!

               <p>Firſt therefore, The difficulty of knowing Oecumenical Councils appears from the diſcord of Authors in numbring them. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reckons 32 which diſtributing into 4 Claſſes, he makes 18 of them to have been approved, 7 condemned, 6 partly approved and partly condemned, and 1 (the <hi>Piſan</hi>) neither manifeſtly approved, nor manifeſtly condemned. <hi>Boſius</hi>

               <p>I find none which deny the 1. <hi>Epheſine</hi> Council to have been General. Yet if any one ſhould do it, he would not want ſome foundation.

                  <note n="l" place="margin">Lup. diſſ. de Concil. Epheſ. cap. 6.</note> obſerveth. In the following Seſſions the <hi>Oriental</hi> Biſhops would not be preſent; but making a ſeparate Synod in the ſame City, anathematized the other; which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49773:40"/>prevailed indeed in number and reaſon, and ſo may be called lawful, but cannot be Oecumenical. The Council of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> is acknowledged by all, yet as to the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Seſſion (in which notwithſtanding all the Canons of the Synod were made) it is rejected by <hi>Baronius, Lupus,</hi> and many others; becauſe the Legates of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Aegypt</hi> were then abſent; whereas the <hi>Greeks</hi> and others contend it was wholly Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical. The V. Council under <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> which was the II. <hi>Conſtant inopolitan,</hi> is admitted for Oecumenical by all the preſent <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines.</hi> Not ſo formerly; when the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, Italians, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> rejected it. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was not Oecumenical. For <hi>Vigilius</hi> and the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, although then at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> would not be preſent in it. The Council in <hi>Trullo</hi> is accounted General by ſome <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi> as <hi>Innocent</hi> III. <hi>Gratian, Bellarmine, Barnes,</hi> and others; denied by <hi>Baronius</hi>

And juſtly might they wonder at it. For although the Roman Legates were preſent: Yet the Weſtern were not either by themſelves or by their Delegates. Not to ſay that the pretended Legatas of the three <hi>Oriental Patriarchs</hi> were ſuborned by the Council, and had no Commiſſion from thoſe <hi>Patriarchs.</hi> That the Council of <hi>Franoford</hi> was called General, <hi>Baronius</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Bar. ad ann. 794.</note> obſerves; Certainly <hi>Hinomar</hi> gave it that name. Nor doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> oppoſe, although in another place<note n="ſ" place="margin">Bell. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. lib. 2. cap. 8.</note> he calls the II <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod more Univerſal. However it could not be General; ſince all the <hi>Greeks</hi> (who were not yet divided from the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> Church by Schiſm) were abſent. The VIII. Synod the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49773:40"/>
                  <hi>Latins</hi> call Oecumenical; the <hi>Greeks</hi> deny it, as the <hi>Engliſh, French</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> did alſo formerly. The <hi>Greeks</hi> on the contrary reckon for the eighth General Council the Synod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Photius,</hi> which is rejected by the <hi>Latins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After theſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reckons eight other Councils eider than that of <hi>Conſtance, viz.</hi> four of <hi>Lateran,</hi> two of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Vien</hi> and <hi>Piſa.</hi> But the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi>

For in his Bull of Priviledge for the Edition of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, he calls it the eighth General Council; whereby he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes all theſe eight, the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> it ſelf, and the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> under <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which commonly bears the Title of the Eighth: of theſe eight, that of <hi>Lyons</hi> under <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> IV. was one; wherein <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. This <hi>Bellarmine, Onuphrius,</hi> and the Aſſertors of the Pope's depoſing Power contend to have been General. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy</hi> and <hi>Widdrington</hi> deny it.

               </p>
               <p>Thus therefore it manifeſtly appears, That there are many Councils, whoſe univerſality was and is ſtill diſputed of; the <hi>Latins</hi> agreeing neither with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> nor among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And if ſo: what certainty can be founded upon their Decrees, to which the very firſt conditions of an infallible Council is wanting? To this may be oppoſed, there are ſome Councils, which none deny to have been Oecumenical; as the I. <hi>Nicene,</hi> that of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in the firſt Seſſions, the VI. and the <hi>Tridentine.</hi> I own the conſent of our Adverſaries herein; and omitting many things, which might be replied, I will chieſly inſiſt upon this, That this conſent of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries is vain and deſtitute of all foundation, and would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vaniſh, if they adhered to their own Hypotheſes. For thoſe conditions, which they require to make a Council Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenical, are not to be found in all theſe Councils; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, are ſuch as create new ſcruples and perplexities.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, <hi>Holden</hi>

What hinders but they may be corrupted at the place of Council? The Councils of <hi>Milan, Ariminum,</hi> and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49773:41"/>
                  <hi>Epheſus</hi> are eminent Examples of this; yea, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf: wherein F. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Hiſt. Cont. Trid. lib. 6.</note> relates, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Biſhops complained there were preſent more than forty Biſhops obnoxious to and Stipendiaries of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> whereof ſome received thirty, others ſixty Crowns a month. Again, that when it was reported at <hi>Rome,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops were on their way to the Council, <hi>Pius</hi> IV. in a great fright called together the Biſhops waiting then at <hi>Rome,</hi> told them how neceſſary their preſence was at the Council, and perſwading ſome with promiſes, others with gifts, haſtily packed them away to <hi>Trent.</hi> The fear of this made the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> to decree, That the Votes ſhould be taken not ſingly, but according to the ſeveral Nations; <hi>It being not reaſonable,</hi> ſaith <hi>Richerius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Nihil cauſae eſt, cur in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ad fidem aut diſciplinam Eccleſ. ſpectantibus una &amp; ſola natio Italica ſibi plus aſſumat &amp; arroget, quàm aliae nationes Chriſtianae. <hi>Rich. Apol. ax. 8.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>that in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Faith and Diſcipline, the</hi> Italian <hi>Nation alone ſhould aſſume and arrogate to themſelves more than any other Chriſtian Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The number of Biſhops therefore affords no certain remedy againſt Factions. But ſuppoſe it doth: Is nothing elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to conſtitute a General Council but freedom from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? Then many National and Provincial Synods will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Oecumenical. Certainly Factions may be wanting in particular Councils, if many Biſhops be preſent; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Oecumenical liberty, if but a few. If that liberty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed any thing, it would be only to enable the Biſhops to proceed Canonically if they would. But that is not the thing we now diſpute of. For particular Councils have been often ſeen to proceed very well, and Oecumenical very ill.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Holden</hi> neither doth nor can define how many Biſhops (or out of how many Provinces) muſt neceſſarily be preſent; but leaves the matter to common prudence; the judgments of which are infinitely various and uncertain, whence no certainty in this particular, upon which all the reſt depend, can be had thence: eſpecially if we conſider that the Biſhops preſent in Councils are ſometimes more, ſometimes fewer. So the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> III. is ſaid to have had above a thouſand Prelates, that of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:49773:42"/>ſix hundred; the I <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> one hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the V. <hi>Lateran</hi> one hundred; that of <hi>Trent</hi> in the firſt Seſſions much fewer. So that Prudence can ſix no certain rule here, and if ſhe be ſatisfied when a great Number is preſent; ſhe cannot but he ſitate, when but a few.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holden</hi>'s Rule therefore is of no uſe to the knowledge of Oecumenical Councils. <hi>Lupus</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But laying aſide theſe, Let us come to <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who hath uſed more accuracy herein. He lays down four conditions of a General Council. Firſt,<note n="i" place="margin">Prima eſt, ut evocatio ſit ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralis, ita ut innoteſcat omnibus majoribus Chriſtianis provinciis. <hi>Bell. de Concil. lib. 1. c. 17.</hi>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49773:42"/>and notified to all the greater Provinces of Chriſtendom: For that this was alwayes obſerved, and for default of it the Council of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>againſt Images was declared void by the</hi> VII. <hi>Synod.</hi> But how ſhall we be aſſured, that this condition was not wanting to any one Council either Antient or Modern, or that certain Intelligence was received in every Province of the indiction of it? Secondly,<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ex Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis nullus exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur undecun<expan>

For not only thoſe are to be eſteemed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded who are openly rejected; but thoſe alſo, who privily by Threats, Promiſes, or any other way are forced to depart: as <hi>Paulus Vergerius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Juſtinople,</hi> by publick Writing complained he was from the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> The third<note n="l" place="margin">

                  </note> condition is, <hi>That all the Patriarchs be preſent either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or by their Legates.</hi> But to this <hi>Bellarmin</hi> adds, That <hi>it is not very neceſſary; becauſe the Council of</hi> Epheſus <hi>without the Patriarch of</hi> Antioch <hi>condemned</hi> Neſtorius, <hi>and the Synod of</hi> Chalcedon <hi>concluded almoſt all things without him of</hi> Alexandria.

If this Argument hold, the preſence at leaſt of ſome Patriarchs will be neceſſary. And whereas he denies the preſence of the Patriarchs to be now neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Heretical or Schiſmatical, this again creates new per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities. For they deny themſelves to be ſo, and 'tis at leaſt very uncertain whether they are ſo: So that this thing muſt be firſt ſearched out and determined, before a firm aſſent can be given to the Decrees of a Council wanting their preſence. See new Difficulties, new Labyrinths Laſtly, With <hi>Canus, Duvall,</hi> and others, he requires, That if not all Biſhops be preſent in the Council, as they cannot all be; at leaſt ſome out of all the greater Provinces meet there.

Beſide, when neither <hi>Bellarmine</hi> nor any other dare determine how many Biſhops out of each Province muſt neceſſarily be preſent, or how many Provinces may ſafely be wanting in the Council; the whole matter cannot but remain uncertain. That alſo deſerves to be obſerved which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> admoniſheth, That it was always thought ſufficient, that when a General Council is held in the Eaſt, a few, ſuppoſe one or two Weſtern Biſhops be preſent; or as few Eaſtern Biſhops in a Council held in the Weſt: as he proveth by divers Examples. But if two or three Biſhops can ſufficiently repreſent one entire part of the Univerſal Church; why may not as many more repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the other part? Which being admitted, a Meeting of four or five Biſhops will conſtitute a General Council, which to me ſeems very abſurd and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Hence it appears therefore, that our Adverſaries can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce nothing ſatisfactory in this matter: which will be yet more manifeſt; if to what we have obſerved already be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they talk much concerning it, but prove nothing. Whereas they ſhould not tell us, what they thought requiſite or ſufficient to conſtitute a General Council, but alſo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it ſo to be, and that ſo clearly, that no doubt might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. Otherwiſe we ſhall be ever uncertain, which are to be called Oecumenical Councils, and which not. Yet nothing of this is produced by them: themſelves rather differ about the conditions; and what one thinks ſufficient or neceſſary, another rejects as inſufficient or unuſeful. So <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thinks it ſufficient that many be preſent in the Council, and none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. <hi>Lupus</hi> denies this to ſuffice, unleſs the abſent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, either before or after the Council, ſhall aſſent. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> holds this aſſent unneceſſary.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> That not all Oecumenical Councils are preſently lawful: That it is very difficultly known which are lawful.</head>
               <p>THus have we conſidered the firſt condition of an Infallible Council, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality.</hi> The ſecond follows of no leſs moment, That, <hi>If it be lawful.</hi> Our Adverſaries confeſs, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49773:44"/>the H. Ghoſt is not indifferently preſent in all Councils, how numerous ſoever. They acknowledge even the moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to have defined erroneouſly. They require them to be rightly and canonically conſtituted, and every way lawful. Whence as often as we object to them the Errours of ſome Councils; they think it enough to anſwer ſuch were Pſeudo-Councils, Conventicles of no value, not lawful Councils, to which alone they allow the priviledge of Infallibility. That the knowledge therefore of the lawfulneſs of Councils is very difficult, however neceſſary to give aſſurance to Faith relying on the Decrees of them, and that no true certainty is to be had therein, I here undertake to prove. And the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this knowledge may hence appear; That it is utterly unknown what are the conditions neceſſary to make a Council lawful. I never yet met with any one, who dare undertake to aſſign them, much leſs demonſtrate them. Some things may be found ſcattered here and there in treating of other matters, but nothing delivered <hi>ex profeſſo.</hi> Yet unleſs this knowledge were fixed, theſe conditions aſſigned, agreed on, and demonſtrated, and their number exactly determined, ſo as we might be aſcertained that neither more were required, nor fewer ſufficed: in vain will Councils define, the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their Decrees will be always uncertain.</p>
               <p>I doubt not, but if God had intended to tie our Faith to the Decrees of Councils; he would either have tied it to all indifferently, or provided that no unlawful Councils ſhould ever be held, or given us plain and manifeſt Rules whereby to diſtinguiſh lawful from unlawful ones. For to permit divers unlawful Councils to be held, to command the faithful to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here only to the lawful ones; and all this while to preſcribe no certain conditions, aſſign no manifeſt Characters of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Council, is highly repugnant to the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God. He might indeed juſtly have left this difficult in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry to us; if it had been accommodated to our ſtrength and capacity. But the diſcord of whole Churches in aſſigning the lawful Councils, and conſequently the Errour of ſome moſt Learned men, manifeſtly evince it to exceed both. So formerly adhered to the V. General Council the whole Eaſtern and the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches; <hi>Africa, France, Spain,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:49773:44"/>openly and vigorouſly rejected it. Each of theſe Churches did then abound with moſt Learned and moſt Holy men; which proveth the thing to have been very doubtful and obſcure, and difficult to be determined. The ſame may be ſaid of the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> as to the firſt Seſſions, <hi>Baſil, Florence,</hi> and the V. <hi>Lateran:</hi> whoſe Lawfulneſs is to this day diſputed of.</p>
               <p>The difficulty of this matter can ariſe only from the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the conditions neceſſary to make a Council lawful. If theſe were fixed, the determination would be eaſie, unleſs the conditions themſelves were intricate and imperceptible. The Monarchiſts, who aſſert thoſe Councils to be lawful, which are called, preſided over, governed, and confirmed by the Pope, all which are eaſily known; can ſcarce doubt which are lawful Councils; whence they all agree in numbring them. Not ſo the reſt: who neither agree in aſſigning the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a lawful Council, nor explain the neceſſity of each condition, nor demonſtrate what they ſay to be true. For Example, the firſt condition given by the Monarchiſts, is, That the Council be called by the Pope. So alſo many of the Sorboniſts: as <hi>Brevicoxa</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Debet Concilium authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Pontificis congregari, niſi in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu in quo Papa eſſet notorius haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus. <hi>Brev. apud Launoi. Epiſt. part. 8. ad Amelium.</hi>

Therefore after a clear paſſage cited out of <hi>Maximus</hi> his Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Theodoſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> he<note n="c" place="margin">Igitur non à Synodorum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocatione, quae ab hoc vel illo fiat, ſed à rectâ fide, quae in Synodis ſancitur, Synodorum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritas depromenda eſt. <hi>Laun.

                  </note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>the authority of Synods not to depend upon the calling of them, whether done by one or other, but upon the truth of their definitions.</hi> Nor without reaſon. For if no Councils were lawful, but what were called by the Pope; then the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had no lawful ones; among whom all thoſe famous and holy Councils were called only by the Emperours: as <hi>Launoy</hi> and others have abundantly demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of the ſecond condition aſſigned by the Monarchiſts, the <hi>Preſidence</hi> of the Pope in the Council ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49773:45"/>by himſelf or by his Legates. <hi>Richerius</hi>

               <p>The third condition is more difficult: which conſiſts in this, That <hi>the Council be made up of thoſe who have a right to be preſent; and none others.</hi> Who theſe are is not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.

                  <note n="m" place="margin">Comm. cap. ult.</note>, vehemently contend that Presbyters, at leaſt Parſons bearing Cure of Souls, have a right to ſit in Councils. This is indeed a great Queſtion, upon which depends the validity of all Councils. There were ſome (as thoſe of <hi>Baſil, Conſtance, Piſa,</hi> and the <hi>Lateran,</hi> by the teſtimony of <hi>Alemannus</hi> an Eye-witneſs) in which Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had a deciſive Vote, but far more (even all the reſt) from which they were excluded. If they have a right; all theſe laſt Councils are unlawful: if not, all the firſt.</p>
               <p>Concerning Abbots there ariſes another doubt. They have ſat in Councils now for many Ages by Priviledge. The firſt who obtained it, as <hi>Lupus</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Lup. Tom. 1. p. 865.</note> obſerveth, was that moſt wicked <hi>Barſumas,</hi> who made no ſmall bawling in the <hi>Epheſine Latroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</hi> But it is inquired, who had Power to give them ſuch
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49773:45"/>a Priviledge. Certainly that Spirit which revealeth Truth, and as our Saviour tells us, <hi>bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> cannot be obliged by any humane Grant to confer Infallibility on thoſe, to whom he never promiſed it. The Monarchiſts themſelves acknowledge the Pope cannot confer on his Legates the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of not erring. How then ſhall either Pope or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil give it to Abbots? But if they cannot; then are unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful all thoſe Councils wherein Abbots ſat, thoſe eſpecially wherein they exceeded the Biſhops in number, as the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> III. in which (by <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s<note n="o" place="margin">Bell. de Con cil. lib. 1. cap. 5. &amp; 7.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation) were preſent 1283 Prelates, of which only 473 Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; and that of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which among a 1000 Fathers had no more than 300 Biſhops. The ſame Queſtion is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved concerning Procurators of Biſhops. For 'tis juſtly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether Biſhops can delegate that Power of defining mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith without danger of Errour, and transfer it upon others that are no Biſhops. For if not, all thoſe Councils will be invalid, wherein theſe Procurators were admitted. Now that they cannot, ſeemeth probable. For to omit that, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchiſts affirm the Pope cannot communicate his Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that Biſhops ſhould be able to do more than the Pope, ſeems incredible; I urge that this Procuration is not allowed even in temporal Cauſes. Judges are not permitted to ſubſtitute others who may give Judgment, and pronounce Sentence in their ſtead. And if this be thought inconvenient in judging the frail and momentany things of life; how much more will it be in defining matters that relate to eternal Salvation? Laſtly, delegated Judges can never ſubdelegate another; unleſs the Delegant ſhall expreſly grant Power of doing it. Let our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries therefore either ſhew where God hath given Biſhops power to conſtitute Procurators to ſit in Councils in their Name; or confeſs it to be uncertain whether thoſe Councils are lawful, in which theſe Procurators ſit.</p>
               <p>They will plead Preſcription perhaps for this; and urge that it is not probable a Cuſtom received and approved by ſo many Ages, ſhould not be lawful. But they have no Right to make uſe of this Argument. For <hi>Widdrington</hi>

Which way ſoever therefore they turn themſelves, they cannot deny it to be very difficultly known which are lawful Councils, and conſequently which, although confirmed by the Pope, can afford certainty and firmneſs to our Faith.</p>

               </p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid, I gather four things: I. That li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in voting is a condition abſolutely neceſſary to a lawful and Infallible Council. II. That this liberty is infringed not only by open force, but alſo by threats, promiſes, gifts, ſolliciting of Votes, or any other ſecret Arts. III. That this may not only be, but hath actually been done, and that more than once. IV. That theſe things are ſo certain, that they are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by our Adverſaries, both Sorboniſts and Monarchiſts. But if theſe be true, as moſt certainly they are; we can never ſafely aſſent to the Decrees of a Council, till we be aſſured that no methods of Violence or Corruption, either manifeſt or ſecret, were uſed to infringe its liberty. But ſince none can know this but God alone, it is thence moſt evident, that we are not only not obliged to a blind aſſent to the Definitions of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but that it would be a moſt groſs folly and manifeſt danger of Errour to do it: becauſe none but free Councils are Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and no man can poſſibly know which are free.</p>

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:49773:48"/>aſſures us, That the <hi>Eſſential Liberty of Councils (which giveth to the Biſhops full power of propoſing what they pleaſe) was wholly taken away; while none were permitted to propoſe any thing but the Popes Legates, upon pretext indeed of avoiding confuſion, but really that all occaſion of diſputing freely concerning the neceſſity of reforming the Church both in Head and Members might be taken away from the Fathers of the Council. And theſe are the fine arts, wherewith the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>upholds her abſolute Monarchy or rather Tyranny. That in modern Councils Biſhops are not fudges and Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators, as they ought to be, but only Counſellors to the Pope, and cannot freely give their Suffrages in the Council; becauſe the Infallible Power and abſolute Will of the Pope, muſt now adayes be received and obſerved inſtead of all Synod, Deliberation, Conſent, Law, Canon, and Communion of Saints: whereby the Church is become the Bondſlave of the Pope, as</hi> Cajetan<note n="a" place="margin">A polop. part, 1. cap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>impiouſly and flatteringly calls her.</hi> But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable oppreſſion of Liberty and various Arts uſed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> F. <hi>Paul</hi> amply relates in his Hiſtory of that Council. You will ſay, perhaps, theſe are falſe, and calumnies. But how doth this appear? Other Hiſtorians perhaps deliver contrary accounts. But how ſhall we be aſcertained they tell truth? If the firſt Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians be disbelieved; why may not theſe alſo? How ever it be, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it is the firſt relation may be true; and until they be proved falſe, we can never be certain they are not true, can never eſteem thoſe Councils free, and conſequently not Infallible. For that the irregularity of a Council is not manifeſt, ſufficeth not to found our Faith upon its Decrees; but to that end the perfect regularity of it muſt be known and evident: which cannot be, while the freedom of it is uncertain.</p>
               <p>But this is not all, <hi>Canus</hi> and <hi>Eſtrix</hi> before truly obſerved, That herein no more account is to be had of <hi>Fear,</hi> than of any other perturbation of the mind: and that he who can be forced by threats to decree againſt his Conſcience, may no leſs vehemently be ſhaken and drawn from the truth by Hatred, Anger, Hope, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or the like. Certainly the efficacy of theſe Paſſions is no whit leſs; and if the H. Ghoſt defends not Biſhops in Council from the impreſſions of Fear, neither will he from the temptations of other Affections. Suppoſe therefore we be aſſured no force was uſed to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49773:49"/>infringe the Liberty of the Council, which we can never be; yet this will not ſuffice, unleſs we be at the ſame time aſcertained that the Biſhops were corrupted with no Paſſions, led by no Affections, and ſerved no Intereſt in giving their Suffrages. Till then we muſt ſuſpend our aſſent to the Decrees of any Council; as juſtly doubting, whether that may not have undergone the ſame unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, which hath attended ſome former Councils. So <hi>Lupus</hi> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Fathers of the I. <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Council of envy againſt the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Biſhops, but eſpecially the Church of <hi>Rome. Liberatus</hi> relates, That <hi>Theodorus Aſcidas,</hi> Favourite to the Emperour <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian,</hi> in revenge of the Condemnation of his admired <hi>Origen,</hi> projected the deſign of the V. Council, and thereby extorted from the whole World the Condemnation of the <hi>Tria Capitula. Duval,</hi> That the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> was blinded with hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Pope <hi>Eugenius.</hi> What happened to theſe, might as well to other Councils, and who can aſſure us it did not?</p>
               <p>But no Liberty ſeemeth more requiſite to the eſtabliſhment of Truth; than that which purgeth the Mind from preconceived O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and addicts it wholly to Truth. For it cannot be hoped, that they who are infected with Errour, ſhould define rightly; and immediately upon their entring the Council, from Patrons of Hereſie become Champions of Faith. This Experience hath often taught. For why did the Councils of <hi>Nice, Conſtantinople, Epheſus;</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> deſine rightly, but becauſe they conſiſted of Orthodox Biſhops? Why the <hi>African</hi> under <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and all the <hi>Arrian</hi> Councils erroneouſly; but becauſe they were made up of Biſhops favouring thoſe Errours? Why the Council of <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> both rightly and erroneouſly, well at <hi>Sardica,</hi> ill at <hi>Philippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis;</hi> but becauſe the Orthodox Biſhops ſtay'd at <hi>Sardica,</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical went to <hi>Philippopolis?</hi> How comes it to paſs therefore, that in aſſigning ſo many conditions of an Infallible Council, this one ſhould be forgotten, the moſt neceſſary of all, that it conſiſt only of Orthodox Biſhops? Wiſely then did the Popes, <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who laboured hard, that only an equal number of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> might be admitted into the IV. and V. Councils, the one fearing the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> the other the Enemies of the <hi>Tria Capitula.</hi> However it be, if Threats and Promiſes, if Fear and Deſire can hinder Orthodox Biſhops from defining truly; much more will preconceived Opinions hinder Heretical ones from decreeing rightly: Since the firſt are drawn to favour Errour unwillingly, and act in it coldly; the latter promote it with their utmoſt Zeal and greateſt Vigour.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:49773:49"/>
               <p>Laſtly, I do not ſee, how if a Council be placed beyond all danger of erring by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, Fear, or any other Paſſions can ſo far prevail in it, as to divert the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of it from the right way. This might indeed be, if Councils were infallible in their Nature, but in their Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, who aſcribe their Infallibility only to the external direction of the Holy Spirit, it is highly abſurd and irrational. For cannot the Holy Ghoſt invincibly arm the minds of thoſe, in whom he dwells, againſt the terrors of Threats or Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of deſire? Why then is the Hymn, <hi>Veni Creator Spiritus,</hi> ſung before every Seſſion of Councils? Why is it expreſly ſaid, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende lumen ſenſibus; Infunde amorem cordibus; Infirma noſtri corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris virtute firmans perpeti?</hi> Why is he called the Living Fountain, Fire, Charity, and Spiritual Unction? Why the finger of Gods Right Hand, but to deſign his powerful Aſſiſtance againſt all the defects of Nature, and infirmities of Mind? This aſſiſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is deſired. If it be obtained, in vain are Threats, Bribes, Promiſes, and other Frauds: they can never corrupt the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. If it be not, who can aſſure us the other part of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition is granted, <hi>viz.</hi> Illumination of Mind to diſcern and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Sophiſtry of Hereticks. But why do I inſiſt on this? If we conſider thoſe Holy Men, in whom the Holy Ghoſt is thought to have dwelt, and armed with his Graces for the defence of Truth, as <hi>Athanaſius, Baſil, Chryſoſtom, Hilary, Ambroſe, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> and the reſt; we ſhall find that they were impenetrable to fear or flattery, and conſtantly deſpiſed both the threats and promiſes of <hi>Arian</hi> Princes. If the Holy Ghoſt therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides over Councils, neither the force nor fraud of Enemies can obſtruct the Infallibility of it; and we may much more juſtly and truly, than <hi>Richerius</hi> did before, apply thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to them, <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> For he alledged them to prove that Liberty is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition pre-required to the preſence of the Holy Ghoſt in a Council: whereas the conſtruction of them manifeſts it to be rather an effect of this preſence: according to that of our Saviour:<note n="2" place="margin">John. VIII. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed:</hi> and<note n="3" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> v. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>the Truth ſhall make you free.</hi> For the Holy Ghoſt is the Spirit of Chriſt; ſo that what is done by the one, may be well attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the other. But to make an end. Our Adverſaries found the Infallibility of Councils upon the promiſes of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49773:50"/>aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt made to the Apoſtles by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in thoſe words, <hi>The Spirit of Truth ſhall guide you into all truth; I will ſend another Comforter,</hi> &amp;c. which they maintain to have been ſpoken not only to the Apoſtles, but to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors alſo to the Worlds end. If ſo, then muſt neceſſarily be conferred on both an Infallibility of the ſame kind and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But were the Apoſtles preſerved by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt from involuntary Errors, and left unarmed to the aſſaults of Threats and Promiſes? Certainly no. Chriſt both promiſed and gave to them his aſſiſtance againſt all kind of Temptations and Corruptions, whereby they might be drawn to betray the Truth. Either Councils therefore have the ſame aſſiſtance, or can pretend no ſhare in theſe Promiſes.</p>
               <p>Two ſeveral ways therefore is the Authority of Councils overthrown by the Doctrine and Conceſſions of our Adverſaries about the neceſſity of their Liberty; both in that it is certain they may be drawn from Truth by any other means as well as defect of Liberty, and uncertain whether there was ever any free Councils. The <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> can oppoſe nothing to this: but the <hi>Monarchiſts</hi> think they can. They pretend that when a Council is thus corrupted, yet the Rock of the Church, the Pope, remains unſhaken, whom no force can move, as for whom Chriſt prayed, that his Faith ſhould never fail. For firſt, the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> deny this; which ſufficeth for me, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that pretended Privilege of the Pope not to be of Faith, and ſo not able to give certainty to the Decrees of a Council, whoſe Liberty is ſuſpected. But then this invincible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of the Pope is demonſtrated to be falſe by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Marcellinus, Liberius, Paſchal</hi> II. and <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. to which we may add a fifth, that of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> from whom the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> after he had extorted by force and threats the Condemnation of the <hi>Tria Capitula</hi> from the fifth Council, extorted an Approbation of the Council's Decree by the ſame Method: as he did afterwards in like manner from his Succeſſor <hi>Pelagius. Lupus</hi>
                  <note n="4" place="margin">Vigilius aerum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis laſſus &amp; libertatis ac ſedis recupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randae amore victus, tandem conſenſit in Synodum. — Pelagius Romani Epiſcopatûs amore ad reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piendam Synodum eſt inflexus. <hi>Lup. in Concil.

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> That it cannot be known, whether the Intention of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Council be right.</head>
               <p>AS Lawfulneſs and Liberty are neceſſary to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Infallible Council; ſo is a right proceeding in it, when conſtituted. This conſiſts in three things; a good Intention, an accurate Examination of the Queſtion to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and a Canonical Concluſion. Every one of theſe beget new ſcruples and perplexities; of which in their Order. Firſt therefore it is required, that the Biſhops, laying aſide all Worldly Intereſts, ſeek only the finding out of Truth, the Glory of God, and Edification of the Church. For they cannot define Truth, unleſs they know it: Know it they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but either wholly by their own Sagacity and Induſtry, or by the Aſſiſtance and Illumination of the Holy Ghoſt. The firſt way muſt be and is acknowledged to be fallible by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who therefore fly to the ſecond, and impute all the certainty of Conciliar definitions to the direction of the Holy Ghoſt. Hence the Maſs of the Holy Ghoſt, and the Hymn <hi>Veni Creator Spiritus,</hi> is wont to precede every Seſſion of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; and this Title preſixed to their Decrees, <hi>The Holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Synod Lawfully Aſſembled in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that other, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us;</hi> which ſuppoſeth the Council to be directed and aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But can we imagine that Holy Spirit illuminates their Minds, whoſe Hearts he doth not ſanctifie, and inflame with love of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49773:51"/>Truth and zeal of Divine Glory? He inſpireth not Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with Sin, and addicted to worldly Conſiderations. So the Author of the Book of Wiſdom:<note n="1" place="margin">Sap. I. 4, 5.</note>

               <p>Theſe places cannot be eluded by ſaying, they ſpeak of a Practical and not a Speculative Knowledge of the Truth.

               <p>It is manifeſt therefore both from Reaſon and the Confeſſion of our Adverſaries, That Truth cannot infallibly be defined in a Council, unleſs the Biſhops bring with them Minds truly deſirous of it, and animated with Zeal for the Honour of God; and moreover, cordially implore the Divine Aſſiſtance.

                  <hi>we give Hereticks leave to call in queſtion the requiſite diligence of the Judges of the Church; who doth not ſee, that all the Decrees of Popes and Councils are preſently overthrown?</hi> He therefore takes Refuge in the Providence of God, and pretends that God, in promiſing Infallibility to his Church, muſt be ſuppoſed to have obliged himſelf thereby, to take care, that neceſſary diligence, which is the means of it, ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be wanting in the Judges of the Church. Hence, ſaith he,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49773:54"/>
                  <hi>the Pope always performs his Duty, the Council their duty, when they pronounce of Faith; and if any of our Divines think otherwiſe, our cauſe is ruined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Argument of <hi>Canus</hi> I obſerve firſt, that he confounds the Means with the Conditions. Diligence is a Condition, which God impoſeth upon the finding out Truth. If the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil neglects this, God is bound to no promiſe: the Error is to be imputed wholly to them. Secondly, if the Council can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect no Conditions, no diligence neceſſary to defining rightly, and always punctually perform their duty; it is impoſſible it ſhould ever err. For the Divine Aſſiſtance will never be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to humane induſtry in Matters of Faith; and when both meet, there can be no Errour. Thirdly, if Councils therefore perform their duty, becauſe God in promiſing to them Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the end, muſt be ſuppoſed alſo to promiſe the means, whereof this is one: Then every Council is infallible, none ought to be rejected, all are indifferently to be received; becauſe God muſt be believed to have promiſed his Aſſiſtance to all Councils, not wanting in their Duty, and alſo to take care that none ſhould be wanting in it. You will ſay perhaps <hi>Canus</hi> underſtands not all, but only Lawful Councils. But I would know what are thoſe Lawful Councils. For Councils are ſuch three ways, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Indiction, Conſtitution, and Proceeding. If you anſwer by the two firſt ways, then the thing is falſe. For the ſecond Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> by the Confeſſion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> was both rightly called an dconſtituted, yet degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and proceeded inordinately. If he means the third way; then his anſwer will come to no more than this, That Councils will proceed rightly, if they proceed rightly.</p>
               <p>But to put an end to this pretence; none will deny, that the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> was lawful: Yet <hi>Canus</hi> confeſſeth, that neceſſary diligence was not always uſed in it. <hi>Some things,</hi> ſaith he,<note n="5" place="margin">Quaedam non conciliariter acta.

But neither in Elder times was due diligence always obſerved. Whoſoever ſhall read the Canons of the Council of <hi>Sardica,</hi> will eaſily perceive how haſtily they were made. <hi>Hoſius</hi> propounded what he thought fit. He asked the Biſhops whether it pleaſed them. They cried out, It did; nothing more was done: his Propoſitions immediately became Canons. So in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in one Seſſion, or rather end of a Seſſion, when the <hi>Pope's Legates</hi> and <hi>Emperour's Commiſſioners</hi> were gone out, thinking the Seſſion was ended, ſuddenly XXVIII Canons were clapt up; whereof every one deſerved a long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
               <p>Neither can you ſay that greater care and diligence is wont to be uſed in defining Matters of Faith. Here alſo it is often wanting. For where ſhould we rather expect to find it, than in weighing the Arguments on both ſides, conſulting the rule of Faith, and ſearching out the ſence of Scripture? yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more frequent in the Decrees of Councils, than to find trifling Reaſons, falſe Gloſſes upon Scripture, and impertinent Allegations. Upon ſuch ſandy and weak Foundations are their Definitions often built. <hi>Canus, Bellarmin, Valentia,</hi> and many

To theſe he might have added many more Examples, and particularly out of the II. Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> where for the ſake of Images, Scripture, Fathers, and Logick are moſt ſhamefully abuſed; ſo as may create Indignation and Laughter together. Now I ask, whether thoſe can be ſaid to have examined the matter in hand diligently, uſed the Rule of Faith rightly, and conſidered the Arguments of both ſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely; who obtrude ſuch impertinent trifles for ſolid founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Decrees? Nay, even in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> where they diſputed ſo ſharply and copiouſly, too much haſt was ſometimes made in their proceedings. Certainly when they decreed the vulgar verſion to be authentick; in whatſoever ſence that be underſtood, they muſt have decided an infinite number of things at the ſame time. For thereby the <hi>Synod</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced there was no verſe in it which was not the pure Word of God, at leaſt contained nothing falſe. How great and how accurate an Examination did this require? Yet none at all uſed, the Verſion not ſo much as read before them; but the thing defined, as if it were ſelf-evident. Raſhly therefore; and if raſhly, why not falſly? In a word, this condition is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther always fulfilled; nor can it be known, but by a very few, when it is ſo.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid, appeareth how raſhly and untruly <hi>Canus</hi> affirmed neceſſary diligence to be never wanting to Councils. <hi>Richerius</hi> therefore having related our Objection and the Anſwer of <hi>Canus,</hi> pronounceth thus.<note n="11" place="margin">Sic difficultatem non ſolvit, ſed potiùs involvit atque incruſtat, ut ſaepè ſolet. <hi>Rich.

                  <hi>that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith the Judgment of the major part ought to be followed.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49773:57"/>hereafter; as becauſe the Hereticks, even although fewer in number in the whole Church, may, incited by a perverſe Zeal, flock to the Council in greater numbers than the Catholicks. Now what can we expect from ſuch an Aſſembly? What, but that every one ſhould pronounce according to his preconceived Opinion, and decree that which he thinks moſt true?</p>
               <p>The fear of this made the Popes, <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Vigilius,</hi> deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the IV. and V. Councils, that an equal number of Weſtern and Eaſtern Biſhops might be preſent in them. For the like cauſe <hi>Richerius</hi>

Thus he computes out of the Acts of the Council, that from the beginning to the end of it there were preſent 187 <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops, but out of other Nations no more than 80. Further, our Adverſaries do not deny, that a Council gathered out of one half of the Chriſtian World may totally err; as for example, The Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> under <hi>Copronymus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 338 Biſhops, who decreed Images were to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. To make this Council Oecumenical there wanted only the preſence of two or three Weſtern Biſhops. Suppoſe them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and oppoſing the Decree of all the reſt. How muſt the Preſident then have pronounced, if with the major part, an Oecumenical Council would have erred, and the Decree would have been Heretical in the Opinion of our Adverſaries?</p>
               <p>Moved with theſe Reaſons, ſome of our Adverſaries, as well Monarchiſts as Sorboniſts, deny, that plurality of Votes ought to overcome in Councils, and account only thoſe Decrees cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which are eſtabliſhed by the unanimous conſent of all.

For, firſt, hereby Councils are in a manner rendred uſeleſs. For it cannot eaſily be imagined, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome Factious Conſpiracy ſhould intervene, that all ſhould think the ſame thing, eſpecially if they be many. And indeed we have few examples of Councils, wherein the Biſhops were unanimous. In that of <hi>Nice</hi> were ſome <hi>Arians,</hi> at <hi>Sardica</hi> more, at <hi>Epheſus</hi> many <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> not a few <hi>Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and ſo of the reſt: which according to this Hepotheſis muſt be all expunged out of the number of lawful Councils. Secondly, The Infallibility of Councils will hereby become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful; for they could never pronounce Sentence. There would be always two or three Hereticks preſent in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who to prevent the condemnation of their Hereſy, need do no more than ſpeak their Minds, and diſſent from the Votes of the reſt. Thus the Power of the Univerſal Church ſhall be overthrown, and all methods of extinguiſhing Hereſy elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſtubbornneſs of two or three Hereticks. However it be, the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> ſo much extol, thought far otherwiſe, and particularly the Preſident of it, <hi>Lewis</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Arles.</hi> For when, in treating of defining three Aſſertions that raiſed a Council above the Pope, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part voted the affirmative, although many Fathers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them the famous Canoniſt <hi>Panoſmitan,</hi> diſſented, and even proteſted againſt it; yet the Preſident pronounced Sentence in the affirmative, and that Sentence was held valid; as <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi>

               <p>Whichſoever Opinion therefore our Adverſaries embrace, they involve themſelves in inextricable difficulties. But I will not any further urge them. It ſuffi eth, what none will deny, that it is not certain, whether the major part muſt take place, or unanimity be required. Both may be defended, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſelf-evident, nor revealed by God, nor defined by the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49773:58"/>Church; as all acknowledge. If this then be uncertain, it will be alſo uncertain what Decrees of Councils were lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and conſequently what command and deſerve belief.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> That it cannot be known from the ſubſequent Approbation of the Church, which were lawful Councils.</head>
               <p>FRom what hath been hitherto ſaid concerning Councils, it is moſt evident both from the Reaſon of Things, and the Principles of our Adverſaries, that the Infallibility of Councils is a meer Phantaſm; that if there were any Infallible Councils, they muſt be ſuch as are <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> free, lawful, and rightly proceeding; that it cannot be yet certainly known, whether all theſe Conditions be ſingly neceſſary, and whether all together ſuffice: That if that were ſtated, it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, what is required to make a Council <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> what Free, and ſo in the reſt; and much more uncertain, which or whether any were ſo; that the lawfulneſs, freedom, right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, neceſſary diligence, and other conditions of an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Council can never be certainly apply'd to any particular Synod.</p>
               <p>Many of theſe things are of that nature, that they cannot be known even by the Biſhops of the Council themſelves. They can tell for example, whether themſelves have a right Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and be corrupted with no Intereſt or Paſſion; but to know whether all the reſt be equally ſincere, is wholly impoſſible. They no leſs than others muſt be uncertain what are the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſary to conſtitute an Infallible Council; which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God hath revealed, the Church defined, nor the conſent of Doctors determined. If theſe things cannot be known by the Fathers of a Council, how ſhall they by the other Biſhops far diſtant in the remote parts of the World? How by every one of the common People, by Mechanicks, Husband-Men, and Women, whoſe Judgment is ſo ſmall, and Notions ſo obſcure? Again, if not of the preſent and later Councils, how of the firſt and ancient ones, which length of time hath involved in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49773:58"/>darkneſs, and left to be known only by Conjectures? How ſhall the moſt learned Men be aſſured of the freedom, legality, and all other neceſſary conditions of theſe Councils, perhaps from the teſtimony of one or two Hiſtorians: as if infinite errors of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians were not daily found out, proceeding either from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, malice, or partiality.</p>
               <p>But both of ancient and later Councils, this is chiefly to be conſidered, That the conditions neceſſary to make them infallible, are of that nature, that one cannot ſupply the defect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It ſufficeth not to have ſome of them, nor even all the reſt, if any one be wanting. This Council muſt at the ſame time be Oecumenical, Lawful, Free, and proceed rightly. If any one of theſe Conditions, or any part of them be wanting, all the reſt are of no value, the Council becomes fallible. Whence many Councils, at leaſt Decrees of Councils, have been reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that were deſicient but in one Condition.</p>
               <p>Hence it may be concluded, Firſt, That the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> have no firm foundation for their Faith, having nothing to oppoſe to ſo many juſt doubts and reaſonable exceptions: For they think not ſufficient the Judgment of the Pope, declaring any Council to have wanted no neceſſary conditions of Infallibility, and reject many, in favour of which he hath ſo declared. They take their Judgment from the ſole conſideration of the Council it ſelf, and what was acted in it. Secondly, That the Sentence of Pope and Council together is no more certain than that of Pope alone; and that thoſe therefore err, who make not the Judgment of either ſeparately, but of both conjunctly to be a firm Foundation for Faith and Certainty. This might be perhaps with ſome colour of Truth defended, if either all Councils agreeing with the Pope, were admitted as infallible; or it were certainly known what are thoſe Councils which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd to the Pope obtain that privilege. But both are falſe. For all our Adverſaries, which acknowledge not the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Pope alone, allow it not alſo to him when united to a Council not Oecumenical, or not lawfully conſtituted, or not rightly proceeding. Now what Councils are Oecumenical, what lawfully conſtituted, and what rightly proceed, we have proved that none can know. Unleſs the Pope therefore hath Infallibility, no certainty can accrue from his Judgment by the addition of any Council. Which is alſo hence confirmed;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49773:59"/>that the Sentence, whereby the Pope pronounceth a Council to have been Oecumenical, Lawful, <hi>&amp;c</hi> comes from his ſole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. For although the Council ſhould pronounce the ſame thing together with him; their Sentence would be of no value, as being pronounced in their own Cauſe. So that the Decree of the Pope alone can not be of any efficacy in this matter; which, if it cannot afford certainty, neither will the Decree of Pope and Council together, at leaſt no more certainty than that of Pope alone.</p>
               <p>Turn therefore the Authority of Pope and Council on all ſides, take it ſeparately, conjunctly, divided, united; no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, no ſirmneſs, no foundation for Divine Faith will be ever obtained. One thing only our Adverſaries may pretend, that the Decrees of Councils become then certain, when the Univerſal Church ſhall have received them. I have not indeed, yet met with any who alledge this. But I doubt not that many forced by the precedent Arguments will take refuge there; and will therefore, before I proceed any farther, demonſtrate the vanity and ſalſeneſs of this pretence.</p>
               <p>And firſt, I oppoſe to it, what I before obſerved, That here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Particular are equalled and put into the ſame condition with General Councils, contrary to the ſence of all Chriſtians, both Ancient and Modern, who conſtantly give the greateſt defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to General Councils. Not to ſay, that ſince hereby firm aſſent cannot be given to a General Council not received by the Church, nor denied to a particular one received by her; it would be fooliſh and abſurd to call a General Council, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite trouble and difficulty, when a particular one may Define and Decree with the ſame Authority. Secondly, If the Church reject ſome Councils, admit others, there muſt be ſome reaſon of this different Judgment. This reaſon muſt be taken either from the Condition neceſſary to the Councils Infallibility, as Univerſality, Freedom, and the reſt, or from the matters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the Council, their conformity or repugnance to the rules of Faith. If from the firſt, all the difficulties which we propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſoregoing Chapters, will take place. For whether ſuch a Council were <hi>Occumenical,</hi> or rightly conſtituted, or did rightly proceed, being all Matters of Fact, the Univerſal Church may err in judging of them: and ſo by her judgment manifeſted in the reception or rejection of the Council, can neither add to,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49773:59"/>nor take away any certainty from it. Beſides, I have ſhewn that the conditions of an infallible Council cannot be known even by the Church when they are fulfilled and when not. For if the Biſhops preſent cannot know it, much leſs thoſe divided by great diſtance of place. Can the <hi>Americans</hi> or <hi>Chineſe</hi> know whether no bribes, no ſollicitation of votes, or making of parties was uſed at <hi>Trent?</hi> The exiſtence of ſuch a Council they know only by uncertain rumours. In vain is a certain knowledge hoped for. However it be, to determine a thing of this nature and moment requireth an accurate and diligent inquiſition and examination of all circumſtances. Such an examination neither ever was nor can be made by the Univerſal Church. For that would require a judiciary kind of proceſs, which the Church out of a Council cannot obſerve. For our Adverſaries aſcribe to the Univerſal Church only a paſſive infallibility in believing, not an active in defining. But grant ſhe can judge of this matter. Did ſhe ever do it? Was the Council of Trent thus examined by her? What witneſſes were heard? What inquiſition made, either by all Biſhops or any other? The Acts of it were always kept ſecret, and are to this day held Priſoners in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> far from being ſubmitted to the examination of the Univerſal Church. The Canons are indeed promulged. But if any one ſhould examine them by himſelf, whether to be admitted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church rejected all thoſe Canons, which concern Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, that reſpects only the matter of the Council, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Truth or Falſeneſs, Juſtice or Injuſtice of its Decrees, but not the form of it, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Legality, Right Conſtitution and Proceeding of it; of which only we are now treating. So <hi>Lupus</hi>
                  <note n="1" place="margin">
                     <hi>In Concil.</hi> Tom. 1. p. 742.7.44.</note> tells us that the reaſon, why almoſt all the Weſtern Biſhops rejected the V. Council, was, not any defect in the form of it, but their reſpect to the Ancient cuſtom of the Church, of Gondemning no man after his Death, that died in Catholick Communion, Honour to the Memory of <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Mopſueſtia,</hi> ſo Famous over all the Eaſt, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the Canons of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> whoſe Authority they thought infringed by the Decrees of this Council. So the Ancient <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> rejected the Seventh and Eighth Synods, only for the falſeneſs of their Decrees, and defining the Lawfulneſs of Image worſhip, which the others looked upon as Idolatry and contrary to the Faith; becauſe <hi>they had
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49773:60"/>defined otherwiſe than the Orthodox Doctors had defined before them,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ademarus Cabanenſis</hi>

                  </note>. Laſtly, that the Church in admitting Councils reſpects the matter, not the form of them, may be hence proved; becauſe the Church ſometimes approveth the Decrees of unlawful Councils, as of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> which<note n="4" place="margin">Ad An. <hi>341.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> accounts unlawful, becauſe Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, while the Indiction of the Synod of <hi>Rome</hi> was yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending: and did certainly act unlawfully in Condemning <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> and ſubſtituting to him <hi>Euſebius</hi> a <hi>Laick,</hi> and when he refuſed <hi>George</hi> the <hi>Cappadocian,</hi> a man unknown to the Church of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Yet the Canons of this Synod were afterwards received, as alſo the Decrees of the V. Council; which <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> and with him not a few think to have proceeded Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully.</p>
               <p>There remains then to the Church only the latter way of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Councils, that is from the Matter of them, by examining the truth and ſalſeneſs of its Decrees, admitting the one and rejecting the other. This Examination we not only admit, but alſo pray that it may obtain. But then in it ſuppoſeth the falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility (in the firſt place) of a Council: otherwiſe why are her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees examined? why not all promiſcuouſly and reverently recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Secondly, hereby not a Council; but the Univerſal Church will be the Supreme and Ultimate Tribunal, as judging and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocably giving Sentence upon the Decrees of the Council, which may be either approved or abrogated by her. Thirdly, hence it will alſo follow, that the Decrees of a Council muſt not be aſſented to, till received by the Church, becauſe not till then certainly known to be true: contrary to the conſtant practice of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, by whom the Decrees are admitted immediatly after Sentence pronounced, at leaſt immediatly after the <hi>Pope's</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. Fourthly, Councils themſelves plainly ſhew that they are of a contrary Opinion by denouncing Anathema's againſt the Oppoſers of their Decrees, or Disbelievers of their Definitions, not ſtaying till the Univerſal Church ſhall have approved both, which demonſtrateth that they believe a ſupreme and uncontrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Authority to reſide in themſelves: And this very argument is made uſe of by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to prove that Councils are Supreme in which the <hi>Pope's Legates</hi> are preſent. Laſtly hence it will follow that the Decrees of a Council ought never to be aſſented to.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49773:60"/>For the Univerſal Church is nothing elſe but the Collection of Chriſtians. If therefore all ſingle Perſons expect till the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church receive the Decrees, the Univerſal Church it ſelf muſt expect; and ſo no body ſhall ever begin to receive and aſſent to them.</p>
               <p>Further, it may be obſerved, that to make this approbation of the Church of any weight, it were neceſſary that this Opinion ſhould be generally received, at leaſt not oppoſed by any Biſhop. For then immediatly after the Promulgation of the Decrees, all Biſhops would betake themſelves to examine them by the Rules of Faith. If after this Examination they received them; then an Approbation of the Univerſal Church might with ſome colour be pretended. But now when all, at leaſt almoſt all, are of a contrary Opinion, and look upon the Decrees, when once confirmed by the Pope, as Infallible; they receive them without any precedent Examination; whereby this Reception becomes of no value, as grounded upon a preconceived Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which we have proved to be falſe. This may be illuſtrated by what an Anonymous Author<note n="5" place="margin">Les deſſeins des Jeſuites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentés a laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblée du Clergé. <hi>p. 43.</hi>
                  </note> of the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> party ſaith. He denieth thoſe Subſcriptions are to be accounted of; whereby many aſſent to the Pope's Conſtitutions when tranſmitted to them; that they are not to be compared with the Decrees of Councils; becauſe the Biſhops act not therein as Judges, nor examine what they ſubſcribe. If this Reaſon be valid in that caſe, it will be much more in the confirmation of Councils by the ſubſequent reception of the Church. For much fewer doubt of the Infallibility of a Council confirmed by the Pope, than of the Infallibility of the Pope alone. He ſubjoineth another Reaſon of the Invalidity of theſe Subſcriptions; becauſe they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly extorted by threats and fear of being depoſed from their Biſhopricks, if they ſhould Diſſent. But hath not this happened in urging the Reception of a Council. Certainly <hi>Baronius</hi>
                  <note n="6" place="margin">Siquidem illi qui damnatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem trium Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulorum non reciperent, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratoris juſſu in exilium age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur. <hi>Bar. ad an. 553.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is certain there are very few Councils, if any, to which all Chriſtians, and conſequently the Univerſal Church ſubſcribed. This was ſhewed before and might be further proved. Whence among many other things theſe two may be concluded: Firſt, that all Chriſtians never thought the Approbation of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49773:61"/>Univerſal Church to be the only Rule of admitting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting Councils; ſince there is none, which although rejected by the reſt, many did not receive. Secondly that the Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous approbation of the whole Church is no ſufficient and ready means to diſcern thoſe Councils to which Obedience is due. For how ſhould it be ſuch, when it is very rarely to be had? Now if this means be not ſufficient; either ſome other muſt be pointed out, which joined or ſubſtituted to it may afford this ſo neceſſary knowledge to the Faithful; or it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that it is often unknown to which Councils aſſent is due. But it ſeemeth incredible to me that God ſhould give to Councils ſo great and ſo admirable a privilege, as is abſolute Infallibility, and this to extinguiſh Hereſies, compoſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and direct the Faithful in the way of truth; and all this while ſhould give no certain or eaſy Sign, whereby Infallible Councils, from which alone we were to receive ſo great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, might be deſtinguiſhed from deluding Conventicles. For this were to violate his own precept, and hide the brighteſt candle in the Church under a buſhel. Yet hath he given none. At leaſt this approbation of the Church, of which alone we now diſpute cannot be here alledged; ſince our Adverſaries have many Councils to which they pretend obedience due, that were not thus approved by the whole Church.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> That it cannot be learned from the conſent of Doctors what is to be beleived. <hi>I.</hi> Becauſe it doth not appear who thoſe Doctors are, <hi>II.</hi> becauſe thoſe Doctors, whoſoever they are, do not always agree.</head>
               <p>DRiven from Pope and Council, our Adverſaries fly to the Faith of the Univerſal Church. Whether herein they have ſure refuge, is next to be enquired. The Faith of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church may be taken two ways, either as it is taught
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49773:61"/>by the Paſtours, or as it is believed, by all the Faithful, both Clergy and Laity. Either way taken our Adverſaries contend it is a certain Rule of Faith to all private Chriſtians; for that nothing falſe can either be taught by a common conſent of all the Paſtors, or be believed by all the Faithful. But ſince it is one and the ſame Faith, which is taught by the Paſtors and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the Faithful, it might ſuffice to conſider either of them only, and thence demonſtrate that neither can be a Rule of Faith. Yet that our adverſaries may not complain any thing is omitted: I will treat ſeparately of each; and firſt that Faith cannot be founded upon the common conſent of Doctors.</p>
               <p>This may be evinced many ways. Firſt, becauſe it doth not appear, who are thoſe Doctors whoſe conſent is required. The whole foundation of this is thought to be a place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note n="1" place="margin">Epheſ. <hi>IV.</hi>
                  </note> where he aſſerts that <hi>Chriſt gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and teachers</hi> (Doctors) <hi>for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. But who theſe Paſtors and Doctors are, is uncertain. It is enquired, firſt, whether the ſame be Paſtors that are Doctors. St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin, Iſidorus Clarius, Ben. Juſtinianus,</hi> and <hi>Lud. Cellotius</hi> thought them the ſame; <hi>Hilarius Diaconus, Eſtius,</hi> and <hi>Corn. à Lapide,</hi> different. Next who are deſigned by the word Paſtors. Many underſtand thereby Biſhops, and thoſe only; <hi>Cellotius</hi>
                  <note n="2" place="margin">Rectè igitur Theodoretus Paſtores &amp; Doctores eos dicit, jui incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate &amp; in pago erant deputati &amp; ſegregati. Cell. de Hier. l. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>

                  </note> underſtands both, who alſo cites <hi>Theophylact.</hi> Now theſe queſtions are of great moment. For if Paſtors be the ſame with Doctors, and by both names Biſhops only be deſigned; they only muſt be attended. But if the Apoſtle underſtands Parſons too, it is not enough to know what Biſhops teach: we muſt alſo enquire what Parſons teach. Again, if Profeſſors of Divinity, and Preachers be to be added; we muſt further ſearch out their Doctrine. For if God annexed this privilege of inſallibility to the four Orders of Biſhops, Pariſh-Prieſts, Profeſſours, and Preachers taken all together; we muſt not ſo follow one Order, as to neglect the other. For upon that ſuppoſition any one, nay any three of them may err, and truth remain only with the fourth. However it be, it is manifeſt that both ancients and modern differ in this point; and that therefore nothing certain can be had therein, much leſs what is of Faith; which yet is neceſſary to aſſure us that we have an infallible Rule of Faith in the Governours of the Church.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:49773:62"/>
               <p>But neither would that ſuffice, if it were of Faith. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe would be yet neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> to know certainly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give aſſent to the Doctrine of theſe Paſtors and Doctors, whoſoever they be, it be required that all ſhould conſent in their Doctrine, every one of them, which they call All <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically;</hi> or whether the conſent of All <hi>Morally,</hi> that is, almoſt all, will ſuffice: again, who they are exactly that may be called All Morally, and how great a part of the whole may diſſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudicing the infallibility of the reſt, whether the third, or the fourth, or the tenth, or the hundredth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who ſhall deſine this? If All Mathematically muſt conſent, God would have appointed a Rule, which never exiſted: For ſo abſolute a conſent never was among the Governours of the Church. But he which ſhall ſay, it ſufficeth that almoſt all conſent, ought not only to aſſirm, but alſo to prove that he ſays. But how ſhall ſo obſcure a thing be proved? Or what certainty can be had in it? Yet grant it can be had; it is ſtill to be defined, when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all can be ſaid to have conſented; for that hath a certain Latitude, wherein ſome Men will think that number to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, which others hold excluded.</p>
               <p>But not to ſeem too ſcrupulous, let our Adverſaries define this as they pleaſe, and almoſt all be accounted to have conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when only a tenth, twelfth, or twentieth part ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Let all this be as certain, as it is indeed doubtful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. I ask, whether that conſent, which it ſhall have pleaſed our Adverſaries to define neceſſary, is always to be had? If any one think ſo, he muſt be a ſtranger to all Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory; and never have heard of the prevailing Hereſies of <hi>Arius, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius,</hi> and <hi>Eutyches,</hi> not to mention others. But you will ſay, they were Hereticks, whereas we require only the conſent of Catholicks. Right; but it did not ſenſibly appear they were Hereticks; rather that was then the Queſtion, Who were He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and who Orthodox. For the <hi>Arians, Neſtorians,</hi> and <hi>Eutychians</hi> took to themſelves the name of Catholicks, and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the reſt with the imputation of Hereſie. Now if this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which was certainly a matter of Faith, was to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined only from the conſent of Doctors, it could never have been determined to the worlds end; ſince that conſent was never to be found. But to deal liberally with our Adverſaries, have not thoſe often diſſented, whom themſelves acknowledge Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick?
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49773:62"/>In the ſecond and third Age the <hi>Aſiaticks</hi> diſſented from the <hi>Europeans</hi> about the celebration of <hi>Eaſter.</hi> In the third Age, all the <hi>Africans,</hi> and many of the <hi>Aſiaticks,</hi> from the reſt, about the re-baptization of Hereticks. In the fourth Age, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Theophilus, Epiphanius,</hi> and St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of <hi>Origen</hi> about his Condemnation. In the fifth Age, the <hi>Greek</hi> from the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, upon account of the Quarrels between the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Sees. In the ſixth Age, the <hi>Africans, Dalmatians,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> from the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> concerning the Condemnation of the <hi>Tria Capitula.</hi> In the eight and ninth Ages, the <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and many of the <hi>Italians,</hi> about Image-worſhip. The <hi>Eaſtern</hi> hath diſſented from the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church now for many Ages about ſome points of Faith and Diſcipline. The <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church hath been divided for theſe three laſt Ages about the Power of Pope and Council. And all theſe Diſſenſions proceeded even to breaking of Communion, and pronouncing <hi>Anathema's</hi> againſt one another, except the laſt, which alſo did no leſs in the fifteenth Age.</p>
               <p>Now as often as this happens, to which part can the Faithful ſecurely adhere? Think not that the moſt are then to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; for beſides that there are not always more Patrons of Truth than Error; and that <hi>Canus</hi>
                  <note n="4" place="margin">Nego, cùm de fide agitur, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui plurimorum judicium opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere. <hi>Can. loc. Theol. l. 5. c. 5.</hi>

                  </note> expreſly deny it: It is impoſſible to number Suffrages, and know which Party is moſt numerous. They might be numbred perhaps, if the Church were included in one Province. But now that it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed throughout the whole World, no mean is left of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is the Opinion either of all or moſt. Our Adverſaries, I ſuppoſe, will ſay, that when the Governours of the Church diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent about any matter of Faith, the Faithful muſt ſuſpend their aſſent, while the Controverſie endureth, and content themſelves by an implicit Faith to believe in it what the Church believeth, not enquiring in the mean while what the Church believeth, but leaving that to be enquired by the Church her ſelf.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, that this grants us all we deſire. For we diſpute here only of explicite Faith, maintaining that our Adverſaries have no certain Foundation for that. If they flee to implicite, they thereby forſake explicite Faith. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, almoſt all our Adverſaries confeſs that there are ſome Articles, which even the moſt ignorant Chriſtians are bound to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49773:63"/>believe with explicite Faith: and <hi>Connink</hi>
                  <note n="6" place="margin">De actib. ſup. diſp. <hi>4.</hi> dub. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> aſſerts the contrary Opinion of ſome Canoniſts to be held erroneous and even he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical by the other Doctors. Further, all conſent there are ſome points of Faith neceſſary to be believed by all with expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Faith, not only becauſe commanded to be ſo; but becauſe the explicite belief of them is alſo the means, without which Salvation cannot be obtained. Wherefore <hi>Hoſius</hi>

                     </gap>ſ. contra Prol. Brent. lib. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note>, in relating the known ſtory of the Collier, ſaith, he did not make that Anſwer, of believing as the Church believeth, before he had entirely repeated the Apoſtles Creed, and profeſſed his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to it. Now ſuppoſe the Biſhops differ about ſome Article neceſſary to be believed with explicite Faith, as happened in the times of <hi>Arianiſm.</hi> Certainly the Faithful cannot at that time ſulpend their aſſent, if they do not together ſuſpend their hopes of Salvation. But not to inſiſt upon that Example, ſuppoſe a Controverſie raiſed about doing ſomewhat, which God in the Scripture expreſly commands to be done, ſuch as we contend to be Communion under both kinds, reading of the Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What is then to be done? Muſt all action be ſuſpended? This were to deny obedience to God. We muſt therefore chuſe one part, and ſo reject the pretence of implicite Faith. Again, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Faith is thus expreſſed, <hi>I believe what the Church believeth.</hi> It therefore ſuppoſeth the Faith of the Church. Of what kind? not implicite ſurely. For that would be abſurd in the higheſt degree. Certainly then the Church could not juſtly be accounted the Keeper of Tradition, which is nothing elſe in our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſence, but that Doctrine which Chriſt delivered to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, they to their Succeſſors, until it was derived down to us. If this be true, the Church of every Age muſt of neceſſity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and explicitly know that Doctrine. Otherwiſe it cannot faithfully and accurately deliver it to the ſucceeding Church. Then how ſhall this Faith of the Church her ſelf be expreſſed? It can be by no other Form than this, <hi>I believe what I believe;</hi> than which nothing can be more abſurd. But I need not refute a Folly which our Adverſaries do not eſpouſe, as appears from the words of <hi>Duvall</hi>
                  <note n="8" place="margin">Quamvis ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua ſucceſſu temporis ſuerint in Eccleſiâ deſinita, de quibus antea eitra haereſin dubitabatur, certum tamen eſt illa fuiſſe ſemper à nonnullis praedicata &amp; declarata. Quòd autem ab aliis non crederentur, iſtud tantùm vel ex ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livione vel ex ignorantiâ Scripturae aut traditionis proveniebat. <hi>Duval. in 2.2. p. 111.</hi>
                  </note>: <hi>Although ſome things were in proceſs of time defined by the Church, which were before doubted of without the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49773:63"/>Crime of Hereſie, yet it is certain they were always preached and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by ſome. But that they were not believed by others, aroſe either from the forgetfulneſs, or from the ignorance of Scripture or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it therefore this explicite Faith of the Church, which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth as a Foundation to implicite Faith? So it ought to be, and ſo I doubt not but our Adverſaries will ſay it is. But in this caſe, wherein the Governours of the Church diſſent about an Article of Faith, it cannot be. For that which the Church explicitly believes, is no deſinite Opinion, but a meer Contradiction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to it ſelf, and deſtroying it ſelf. For one part of the Church believeth the Opinion, whereof the Controverſie is raiſed, to be true, wholſom, and revealed by God; the other part believes it falſe, pernicious, and ſuggeſted by Men. Now, to have the belief of the whole Church, you muſt joyn both parts of the Contradiction together: and ſo the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth that Opinion to be true and falſe, wholſom and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, revealed by God, and ſuggeſted by Men. But this is not Faith, but a deformed Monſter, conſiſting of contrary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant parts.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> That the conſent of Doctors, even when it can be had, is more difficult to be known, than that we can by the help of it attain to the knowledge of the Truth.</head>
               <p>TO what we obſerved in the precedent Chapter our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries may perhaps anſwer, That when the Governours of the Church differ about a matter to be believed, then indeed the Faith of private Chriſtians cannot rely upon their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but that this diſſent is not perpetual, that they oftentimes conſent in delivering the Doctrine of the Church, and then at leaſt may be ſecurely believed in what they teach. To this I reply, Firſt, that hereby they muſt grant they have no certain and ſixed Rule of Faith for many great and weighty points of Religion, contrary to their continual boaſts of the abundance
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49773:64"/>of Rules, whereby God hath provided for all the neceſſities of his Church. Secondly, the Governours of the Church have now for many Ages differed about ſome matters, upon which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Adverſaries, depend the hopes of eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For Example, whether the true Church is to be found among the <hi>Greeks</hi> or among the <hi>Latins?</hi> For of the five Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archates of the Church, four are divided from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and accuſe her of Hereſie and Schiſm, both which Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations ſhe retorts upon them. Now, this is a matter of great moment, which may be juſtly doubted of, and can never be determined by the conſent of Doctors.</p>
               <p>But to omit that, this conſent, if it could be had, is not ſo manifeſt and obvious, as a Rule of Faith ought neceſſarily to be; which by the confeſſion of all muſt be clear, evident, and eaſie to be applied. This <hi>Duvall</hi>
                  <note n="1" place="margin">Secunda conditio, eaque pariter eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentialis, eſt perſpicuitas. Nam ſi hee regula obſeurè ſidei myſteria pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneret, regula fidei non foret. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall in 2.2. p. 207.</hi>
                  </note> aſſigns for <hi>an eſſential condition of a Rule of Faith,</hi> and acknowledgeth, that <hi>if a Rule obſcurely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Myſteries of Faith, it would thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no Rule.</hi> And for this reaſon our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſo much exaggerate the obſcurity of Scripture, that they may thereby ſhew it could not be given by God for a Rule of Faith. To which end, <hi>Gr. à Valentia</hi>
                  <note n="2" place="margin">Sententiam ejus authoritatis, cujus de rebus omnibus ſidei judicium eſt, apertam oportet eſſe, ut ab omnibus fidelibus commodè poſſit intelligi.

                  </note> layeth down this Axiom, which he afterwards applyeth to the Scripture. <hi>The Sentence of that Authority which is to judge of all matters of Faith, ought to be manifeſt, that it may be eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by all the Faithful. For if that Authority doth not teach perſpicuouſly and plainly, it will be of no uſe to that end.</hi> So he, and with him many others. If therefore I ſhall ſhew, that the conſent of Paſtors about matters of belief is ſo obſcure and difficult to be known, that even the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, much more illiterate men cannot avoid Error in ſearching it out; I ſhall thereby prove, that it could not be given to us by God as a common Rule of things to be believed.</p>
               <p>This obſcurity and difficulty ariſeth from three Cauſes. The firſt is the amplitude of the Church diffuſed throughout the whole World; which permits not the Faith of all Paſtors to be known, unleſs we travel through all thoſe Regions, wherein they are diſperſed. For it ſufficeth not to conſult a few. They may be miſtaken. The Opinion of all muſt be asked, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

He ſaith, the uniformity of the Church is manifeſt to ſenſe; that all parts of the Church may be ſurveyed by one man at divers times, or by divers men at one time. True; but to reduce this to practice, every ſingle man muſt take ſo many Journeys, ſend out ſo many Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; that this Method cannot be perſwaded but in jeaſt. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia</hi>

               <p>Of Indulgences our Adverſaries teach chieſly three things. I. That there is a Treaſure of the Satisfaction of Chriſt and the Saints, which may be applied to perſons liable to ſuffer the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their ſins, after the guilt of them is remitted in the Sacrament of Penance; and that this Treaſure is actually applied by Indulgences granted by the Pope. II. That the Souls in Purgatory may be helped by theſe Indulgences. III.

               <p>It is a Famous Queſtion, whether the Pope, beſides the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Power, commonly attributed to him, hath a power over Temporals, either direct or indirect, whereby he depoſes Princes for Hereſie, or any other Crime, and abſolve their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their Allegiance. There are three Opinions about this. The firſt is, that the Pope hath, <hi>jure divino,</hi> a direct and abſolute Power over the whole World, as well in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, as in Spirituals. The Second, that the Pope, as Pope, hath no Temporal Power, nor any Authority to deprive Princes. The Third, that the Pope, as Pope, hath not directly any Temporal, but only Spiritual Power; yet that by means of that Spiritual, he hath indirectly a Supream Power even in Temporals. <hi>Bellarmin</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I might produce many more examples; but theſe ſuffice to ſhew, That the greateſt Doctors miſtake in imagining ſome O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions to be approved by all the Divines of their Communion, which yet are freely diſputed of on both ſides. And if this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to Doctors, who employ their whole time in matters of learning, what ſhall we think of poor and illiterate Men, who know little beyond the providing for the neceſſities of this life? Again, If the Judgment of only thoſe Doctors, who commit their Opinions to Writing, and are very few in compariſon of the reſt, is not certainly known; how ſhall we know the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who teach their Flocks <hi>vivâ voce?</hi> Laſtly, If their Opinion be true who would have the Judgment not only of Biſhops, but alſo of Parſons, Profeſſors of Divinity, and Preachers to be accounted of? what hope is there, that the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of ſo many Men ſhould ever be known to any one Man, or to any but God alone?</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon of the difficulty of knowing the common conſent of other Doctors, is, the obſcure Knowledge which is in the Church, of ſome points, concerning which no Diſputation hath been yet raiſed. For nothing is more true, than that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are illuſtrated by Controverſies. So St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>

And perhaps,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſome do yet lay hid in the Church.</hi> An eminent example of this appeared in the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> when they were ſeeking out an eſſicacious remedy againſt the inconveniencies of clandeſtine Marriages. Some adviſed the declaring them void for the future; and theſe were the major number. Fifty Biſhops, and among them the Patriarch of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and two of the Legates, Card. <hi>Hoſius</hi> and <hi>Simonetta,</hi> oppoſed it, ſaying, <hi>That was not in the power of the Council. Morone</hi> the Legate, and many others ſuſpended their Votes. The Diſputations grew high; at laſt they agreed to referr all to the Pope. He anſwered, the Council had Power to make ſuch a Decree, and that it ought to be made. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on clandeſtine Marriages were declared void; and an <hi>Anathema</hi> added to the Decree againſt all thoſe who ſhould thenceforth deny the Church hath power to make Conſtitutions of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. See a Power reſiding in the Church now become an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, which was vehemently impugned by a Patriarch, two Legates, fifty Biſhops, and doubted of by many others. And ſhall thoſe now be heard, who maintain there is always in the Church a clear and diſtinct knowledge of all things reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
               <p>We proceed to the third Reaſon, which conſiſteth in this, That ſome Opinions are often divulged in the Church as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God, and approved by the Church, and are every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where taught, which at laſt are found out and known to be falſe. Monſieur <hi>Pajon</hi>
                  <note n="24" place="margin">Rép. aux prejugès part. 2. chap. 2.</note> produceth three eminent Examples of this Obſervation; the firſt taken from the deciſions of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts, the ſecond from the form of Condemnation of the V.

                  <hi>Janſenian</hi> Propoſitions; the third from the Prohibition of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bible; which becauſe he largely and accurately purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, I will not here urge; much leſs will add other Examples before pointed out in this Chapter. However, from what hath been ſaid, it appears, that it is obſcure and difficult to be known wherein the Doctors conſent. This will be more manifeſt, if we conſider, that it is far more difficult to know certainly what all the preſent Doctors teach, than what the former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors taught. For the Opinions of theſe we have in their Books, which we can read at home; but to know the Judgment of the others we muſt travel through the whole World. <hi>Valentia</hi> ſuppoſeth this very thing, where he giveth the reaſon why the Pope in deſining rather maketh uſe of dead than living Doctors: <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he,<note n="25" place="margin">Qui proinde omnes nec faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lè congregari nec interrogari poſſunt quid ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiant. <hi>Val.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>the Opinion of theſe latter can very rarely be ſufficiently known. For being diſperſed through the whole Church, they cannot all eaſily be either aſſembled, or asked what they think; whereas the ancient Doctors are more famous, and are not ſo many.</hi> If this be true, how diſſicult muſt it be to know the Judgment of the preſent Church; ſince the moſt learned Men can very hardly obtain the Sence of the Ancient Church? Few or none can ſearch all the Monuments of Antiquity, pry into the moſt ſecret Receſſes of it, and turn over the Writings of ſixteen Ages; and in all this long Journey make no ſlips, commit no errors: Yet is all this eaſier in the Judgment of <hi>Valentia,</hi> than to enquire and find out the Opinion of the Doctors living at any one time; which yet muſt be done by them, who lay the Foundation of their Faith upon their conſent.</p>
               <p>I have not yet ſeen any of our Adverſaries, who offereth the leaſt ſolution of any one of theſe difficulties, except Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Richlieu;</hi> who when he had objected to himſelf, That blind Men hear neither all Preachers and Doctors, nor learn from thoſe, which they do hear, what the others teach, which is our very Argument, except that what he ſaith only of Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, we juſtly apply to all Men; he anſewers,<note n="26" place="margin">Method. liv. 2. chap. 8.</note> That <hi>as for a Philoſopher to conclude all Fires to be hot, it is not neceſſary that he experiments all the Fires in the World, the common conſent of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſufficing: ſo to know certainly, whether any Doctrine be the Doctrine of the Church it abundantly ſufficeth, that Blind-men hear it propoſed by divers Doctors of the Church, and that it cannot be ſhown there are others who teach the contrary.</hi>

               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:49773:67"/>
               <p>But many things may be here obſerved. Firſt, Thoſe things do not always ſuffice in matter of Faith, with which we are contented in diſputing. There we often argue from Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which we own to be falſe: Here nothing is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced but what is true and certain. Wherefore if no body oppoſe thoſe Doctrines which ſeem true to us, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that we ought to admit them, unleſs they be both certain of themſelves, and appear ſo to us: And if no body points out to us any maintainers of the contrary Doctrine, it doth not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>refore follow, that there are none; whence the Doctrine propos'd, obtains not thence any certainty, any motive of Faith. Secondly, Philoſophers themſelves admoniſh, great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence is to be uſed in making Arguments of <hi>Induction,</hi> ſuch as this is; and that an inſufficient enumeration of particulars is the great fountain of Errors; while a few, or even many, are reckoned up, and thence a concluſion made of all. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reaſons not well, who argues th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Such and ſuch teach thus; nor doth any appear who oppoſeth, Therefore all teach the ſame</hi> For it may eaſily be that many may teach otherwiſe, unknown to him who reaſons thus, but well known to others.</p>
               <p>In the next place, it were to be deſired the Cardinal had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained his mind more clearly, and told by whom he means it cannot be ſhewn that other teach the contrary; whether by the blind Man himſelf, or by other blind or ignorant Men like himſelf, or by one Learned Man whom he ſhould conſult, or by all Learned men every where diſperſed. If he means the firſt or ſecond, then he greatly errs in thinking it ſufficient that the blind Man or other ignorant Perſons of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance cannot name any, who teach a contrary Doctrine to their Pariſh-Prieſt or thoſe Doctors whom they hear. For all the Husbandmen, Labourers, and Mechanicks of the Pariſh may be eaſily ignorant, that a contrary Doctrine, and that more true, is taught in <hi>America</hi> or <hi>India</hi> or even the next Province; and ſo the blind Man ſhall be obliged to believe a falſity. But if the Cardinal means it ſuffice, that the blind Man conſult ſome learned Man to know, whether none teacheth contrary to his Parſon; I would ask, whether our Adverſary requireth it as neceſſary? If ſo, then all the common ſort of the Faithful are guilty of raſhneſs and imprudence. For I dare ſwear that none of them ever puts this in practice. If he ſaith it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49773:68"/>he deſerts the cauſe. For upon what foundation ſhall their Faith rely, who do not that which he confeſſeth not neceſſary to be done, and yet think ſufficient to confirm their Faith? But what if the Doctor, who is conſulted, be in the ſame errour with the Pariſh-Prieſt, as none will deny he eaſily may? It cannot be imagined that Doctor will tell the conſulter the thing is not taught by the Church, which himſelf thinks to belong to Faith. Or what if that Doctor be ignorant that others, and thoſe Learned Men teach the contrary; as we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved might eaſily happen in the precedent chapter? That anſwer ſurely cannot be ſufficient to ground Faith upon, which can be falſe. For as <hi>Martinonus</hi>
                  <note n="4" place="margin">Ad creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum fide indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitatâ &amp; infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libili; qualis eſt fides divina, requiritur argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile. <hi>Mart. de diſp. 3. ſect. 4.</hi>
                  </note> truly ſaith. <hi>To believe with undoubting and Infallible Faith, ſuch is Divine Faith, is required an Infallible Argument.</hi> Laſtly, that the Cardinal meaneth it ſufficeth that none in the World can ſhew the Parſon teacheth what is repugnant to others, I can never be induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſince a more fooliſh ſence could not be invented. For not the moſt ſagacious Perſon, much leſs a blind Man, could make ſo diligent an inquiry as to be aſſured that none ſuch can be found in the whole World. Add hereto, that it is not more difficult to know directly whether any do teach otherwiſe, than to know whether there be any who can ſhew that it is any where taught otherwiſe: And ſo all our former Arguments will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with their full force againſt this anſwer. But to omit all this, I ask whether any ignorant Perſon uſing ſuch diligence to inquire whether what is taught by his Parſon, is taught una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly by all the other Governours of the Church, as can be expected from a Man of his circumſtances and capacity, can be deceived therein? If he cannot; all thoſe Learned Men, whom I mentioned in the laſt Chapter will be guilty of a moſt intolerable negligence and ſupinity, as being miſtaken in that, wherein even the moſt ignorant cannot be deceived. If he can, then he is not certain, and therefore hath no Faith. For Faith muſt be certain.</p>

If therefore, whatſoever all propoſe, muſt neceſſarily be true; there can be nothing falſe, nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain in this Book. Yet none will deny there are taught in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49773:69"/>it many Propoſitions falſe, more uncertain, and none which might not ſafely be denied, if they received not their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from ſome other Fountain. Wherefore it is no whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re admitted as of Infallible authority; a manifeſt Argument, that thoſe things may be falſe, which are not taught as of Faith, although taught unanimouſly.</p>
               <p>Before we believe therefore the Doctrine of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, we muſt conſider how they teach it, whether as of Faith; if not, we muſt ſuſpend our aſſent. Now Biſhops, Parſons, and Preachers, are wont to teach what ſeems true to them, and agreing with Divine Revelation; but very rarely to admoniſh whether what they teach be of Eaith, or a conſequent of Faith, whether expreſly revealed, or cohaerent to things revealed. This <hi>Holden</hi> acknowledgeth. <hi>We never heard,</hi> ſaith<note n="4" place="margin">In Doctrinâ Chriſtianâ tradendâ nunquam audivimus Eccleſiam arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culorum revelatorum &amp; divinarum inſtitutionum Catalogum exhibuiſſe vel compoſuiſſe, quo ſeparatim &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlinctè cognoſci poſſent hujuſmodi ſidei dogmata ab aliis omnibus, quae vel Ecclèſiaſticae ſunt inſlitutionis, vel certè quae revelationi divinae haud im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatè innitantur; atque adeò om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ſimul confusè &amp; indiſtinctè do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuiſſe. <hi>Hold.

                  </note> he, <hi>that the Church in delivering the Chriſtian Doctrine exhibited, or compoſed a Catalogue of revealed Articles, and Divine Inſtitutions, whereby theſe Articles of divine Faith might be ſeparately and diſtinctly known from all others, which are either of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Inſtitution, or not immediately founded upon Divine Revelation, but taught all together confuſedly and indiſtinctly.</hi> Hence even thoſe Divines who agree in the truth of any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, often diſſer in judging whether it be of Faith; as we ſaw before concerning the ſupreme Power of the Pope. Wherefore <hi>Holden</hi> aſſirms there are much fewer Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Divine and Catholick Faith, than Divines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly think; and therefore beſtows the whole Latter part of his Analyſis in compoſing a Catalogue of ſuch Articles: which would indeed have been very uſeful, if it were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all. But he hath omitted ſome things, which others contend to be of Faith; and inſerted others, which ſome would have omitted. Further in this matter, I appeal to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all Perſons; who if they ſhall ask any of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries what the Church teacheth concerning Image worſhip, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints, or the like, will be convinced by their different anſwers, That it is not eaſie to ſay what the Church teacheth. And if this be diſſicult to learned Men, how ſhall it be poſſible to ignorant Perſons?</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:49773:69"/>
               <p>Our Adverſaries cannot juſtly pretend, as many of them do, that the Doctors may diſſent in thoſe things, which are of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical, not Divine right, and belong rather to the Schools than to the Pulpit, without either the knowledge or the damage of the People; but cannot diſſent in matters of Faith, unleſs their diſſenſions be preſently known, becauſe diſputations, ſtrifes and Schiſms preſently ariſe from them, which occaſion either the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of a Pope or the calling of a Council to extinguiſh the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion, and caſt the heretical part out of the Church. That every Laick therefore, both may and ought to be perſwaded of the truth of thoſe things, which his Paſtour teacheth to be of Faith, while he ſeeth none oppoſing him; although himſelf doth not inquire, whether others teach the ſame thing. So <hi>Suarez</hi>
                  <note n="5" place="margin">De fide diſp. 5. Sect. 1.</note>. But here many things are ſuppoſed which cannot be granted. Firſt, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that as often as a Doctor propoſeth any thing to be of Faith, which is not ſo, ſome others ſhould riſe to oppoſe him. We daily ſee the contrary not only in Pariſhes, but even in Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, where the Wits of Men are more eaſily excited to contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy: yet there ſome affirm, others deny many matters to be of Faith, without any ſubſequent Schiſms or Animoſities.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if any Diſputation, or Oppoſition ſhould ariſe herein; it is not neceſſary it ſhould ever come to the ears of the common People. Every one knows how hot the Controverſy about the Pope's Infallibility hath for ſome Ages been, eſpecially in <hi>France,</hi> where are many Defenders of each Opinion. Yet ſome Years ſince, when I was in that Country, talking with a Prieſt, and him no ordinary Perſon, but a man famous in the neighbourhood, and Doctor of Divinity, when I ſaid the Pope's Infallibility was denied by many, and particularly by the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> he grew very angry, ſaid it was moſt falſe, and confidently maintained that no Catholick Divine ever doubted of it. Nor could I free the Man from his errour, whatſoever I then offered to him. See another example more remarkable. I was preſent at <hi>Paris</hi> in an Aſſembly of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men, who met weekly to treat of matters of learning. They then diſputed of the Pope's Infallibility, which a Prieſt ſaid was lately rejected by the <hi>Gallican</hi> Clergy in their Synod. At that an Abbot who preſided over the Aſſembly, and had the repute of a very Learned Man, was not a little moved, and denied any ſuch thing was ever done by the Clergy. He acknowledged indeed that the Pope could err, whenſoever he gave his opinion as a Private
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49773:70"/>Doctor, and that the Clergy meant no more than this: but that there was no Catholick, who did not hold his judgment Infallible, whenſoever he pronounced <hi>ex cathedrâ:</hi> and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Prieſt could ſay, he would not be perſwaded that there was any diſſenſion among Divines in this matter. If this Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Abbot could be ignorant of ſo notorious a thing; what ſhall we think of illicerate Chriſtians?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is not neceſſary, that as often as diſſenſions ariſe in matters of Faith, Schiſm ſhould thence immediately be produced, and occaſion a Decree of the Pope, or calling of a Council. How many things did <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Mopſueſtia</hi> teach againſt the Faith, which yet were not canvaſſed of many Years after his Death? All acknowledge the number of Canonical Books of Scripture, the neceſſity of the Euchariſt, and ſtate of the Dead to be of Faith: Yet none will deny the Ancients dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in judgment as to all theſe things; and all know that no Schiſms, Diſputes, or Anathema's of Councils aroſe therefrom. But not to depart from this very queſtion: What can be more of Faith, than the Rule of Faith it ſelf, and the moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial condition of that Rule, Infallibility? Many Doctors of the Church denied this in the XIV. and XV. ages, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved; yet no Schiſm, no Decree of the Church was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned thereby.</p>
               <p>But to ſhew the ſophiſtry of this objection more evidently, it may be obſerved, that there are five ſorts of things, which, although not belonging to Faith, may be in the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as of Faith. I. Things true, but not revealed. II. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true nor revealed, but not repugnant to Revelation. III. Repugnant to things revealed, but ſuch, as it is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that they were revealed. IV. Repugnant to things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly revealed, but ſo as that repugnance is obſcure and remote, not clear and immediate. V. Clearly repugnant to things manifeſtly revealed. Concerning matters of the laſt rank this objection might have ſome force, but not much: ſince the contrary may be ſhewn in ſome examples. But for the four firſt Claſſes it hath no colour of truth. They may be all taught as of Faith, and that, daily, yet be obſerved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by none, much leſs violently oppoſed by any. The want of apparent oppoſition therefore ſufficeth not to make what any one Doctor propoſeth as of Faith, to be ſo. The conſent and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49773:70"/>concurrence of all in teaching the ſame to be of Faith, muſt be aſcertained. Otherwiſe aſſent to it will be fooliſh and raſh, at leaſt uncertain.</p>

               <p>THat it is uncertain, what the Governours of the Church unanimouſly teach, we have proved; yet grant it certain: Can we ſecurely believe this their unanimous conſent?

                  <note n="1" place="margin">In 2. 2. p. 106.</note>, and many others. And indeed, if it be not of Faith that all the Paſtors conſenting cannot err, Faith cannot rely upon their Authority. Yet is this moſt falſe; for we before proved theſe two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. I. That nothing is of Faith, whoſe contrary is held and taught by Catholick Divines, the Church knowing and not cenſuring their Oppoſition. II. That the greateſt Divines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, Doctors, Biſhops, and Cardinals taught; 1. That the whole Clergy might be infected with Hereſy. 2. That the Church, to which Infallibility was promiſed, might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in one Laick, or one Woman, the reſt apoſtatizing from the Faith. This was the Opinion of <hi>Alenſis,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Gloſs upon the Decretals, Lyra, Occam, Alliaco, Panormitan, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recremata, Peter de Monte, S.

Picus.</hi> But who can imagin ſo many, and ſo great Men, either not to have known what is of Faith, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to have taught the contrary?</p>
               <p>This moved <hi>Suarez</hi> to eſteem the Infallibility of the Paſtors thus conſenting uncertain. <hi>It is asked,</hi> ſaith he<note n="2" place="margin">Petitur an omnes Epiſcopi Eccleſiae poſſint convenire in aliquo errore.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49773:71"/>it, becauſe there is no promiſe found (of the contrary:) Others deny it, becauſe the whole Church would be otherwiſe in great danger of error. To me neither ſeemeth ſufficiently certain. Yet it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that it becomes the Providence of Chriſt not to permit it.</hi> In theſe words two things may be obſerved. Firſt, That <hi>Suarez</hi> ſpeaks of the Infallibility of Biſhops not in believing, but in teaching. For he ſaith this in anſwer to an Objection, That if all the Biſhops could err, then the other part of the Church, the Laity, might alſo err, becauſe they ordinarily follow the Doctrine of their Paſtors, and are bound to do it. Now the People are bound to follow their Paſtors, not in what they think, but in what they teach. This alſo appears from the reaſon why ſome denied the conſent of all Biſhops in any error to be poſſible, becauſe, if that ſhould happen the whole Church would be brought into great danger of error. But if Biſhops ſhould teach rightly, although they thought erroneouſly, there would be thence no danger of Error to the reſt of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Secondly, Of this Infallibility of Biſhops in what they teach unanimouſly, he ſaith three things. 1. That ſome Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks deny it. 2. That neither part ſeems certain to him. 3. That it is probable. All which ſingly prove, That he thought it not to be of Faith. But who can imagine ſo great a Doctor could be ignorant of what was of Faith?</p>
               <p>

               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:49773:71"/>
               <p>Hence is manifeſt, that we want little of a Confeſſion from our Adverſaries, that the Infallibility of the Governours of the Church is not of Faith. And indeed it cannot be. For no Foundation of ſuch a Faith is to be found: Not Scripture or Tradition. For not to ſay, that theſe, to make any Article be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of Faith, ought, according to our Adverſaries, moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to contain it; which evidence even they will not deny to be here wanting: It would be moſt abſurd, that Papiſts ſhould believe this Infallibility of the Paſtors of the Church for the Authority of Scripture and Tradition; when they believe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe, but for the Authority of the Paſtors. Take away their Teſtimony, and they will deny it to be known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture or Tradition be the word of God, or what is the ſence of either. The ſame may be ſaid of the Decrees of the Church Repreſentative. For beſides that no ſuch expreſs Decree of it can be produced, the Infallibility of the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative Church it ſelf is believed by every ſingle Papiſt, only becauſe they hear it taught by their Paſtors. As for the belief of the Univerſal Church, that ought not be produced. For that is the thing now inquired, why the Univerſal Church believeth ſo?</p>
               <p>Will our Adverſaries therefore ſay, they believe their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors cannot err in teaching unanimouſly what is of Faith; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſo teach themſelves? This they muſt recurr to; for they have no other reaſon left of believing ſo: Yet nothing can be more abſurd. For firſt, it is the conſtant Opinion of all Mankind, and a received Law among all Nations, that none ſhould be Witneſs or Judge in his own Cauſe. Secondly, As we believe not any Man to be true and honeſt, till we be aſſured of his veracity and honeſty from ſome other Teſtimony than his own: So it would be the higheſt imprudence to eſteem thoſe Infallible, who challenge that privilege to themſelves; until their Infallibility be known to us from ſome other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than their own Teſtimony. Certainly our Adverſaries will not permit even the Scripture, which is the word of God, and hath ſo many illuſtrious Characters of a Divine Original, to be believed for its own Teſtimony; and Chriſt openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that if he bore Witneſs of himſelf, his Witneſs was not credible. Why then ſhall that be attributed to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church; which Chriſt denied to himſelf, and our

For firſt, there is none of the Paſtors which believeth ſo, becauſe he teacheth ſo; but all teach ſo, becauſe all believe ſo. Again, The Queſtion will recurr upon what Foundation do they teach ſo? Here either nothing, or only this muſt be anſwered, That they teach ſo becauſe they believe ſo.

               <p>THus far have we conſidered the Faith of the Univerſal Church, as it is taught by the Paſtors or Clergy. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that we treat of it as it is believed both by Clergy and Laity; which is the laſt refuge of our Adverſaries. Here I undertake to prove, That there is nothing whereon the Faith of all private Chriſtians can leſs rely; and that for three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 1. Becauſe it doth not appear what is that Univerſal
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49773:73"/>Church, whoſe Faith is to be the Rule of ours. 2. Becauſe it is not known what is the Faith of that Church. 3. Becauſe it is not manifeſt whether the Faith of any Church aſſignable, be true.</p>
               <p>The firſt is evinced two ways. For firſt, it is uncertain what is the true Idea or Definition of the Church, what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to conſtitute it, whether only an external profeſſion of the true Faith, or alſo internal Faith and Piety: And then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this were certain, it would be yet unknown, whether the <hi>Roman, Greek,</hi> or any other, were that true Church. As for the firſt, our Adverſaries would perſwade us, That they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the notion of a true Church. Yet nothing is more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt than their diſcord in this matter. There are chiefly three Opinions of them herein: For if we ſhould make an exact enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of them, we ſhould find many more. The firſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That the Church is made up of all perſons baptized, and outwardly profeſſing the true Faith, and adhering to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether they be truly Faithful, or ſecretly Inſidels. The ſecond to an External Profeſſion, requires Internal Faith, at leaſt in form, to be added as neceſſary; and thereby excludes all ſecret Inſidels and Hereticks. The third requireth Charity to be added to theſe two, and leaveth no place in the Church, but to thoſe who are truly juſt, and free from Mortal Sin.</p>
               <p>The firſt Opinion is defended by many, particularly <hi>Canus, Bellarmin, Duvall,</hi> and almoſt all the later writers of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, eſpecially the <hi>French.</hi> The ſecond is taught by many: For all thoſe ſeem to favour it, who deſine the Church to be the Congregation of the Faithful; of whom <hi>Launoy</hi>
                  <note n="1" place="margin">Laun. Epiſt. Tom. 8. ad Gattin.</note> reckons up a very great number.

For to conform themſelves to this Rule of Faith, they muſt firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly know it; which cannot be, if they know not what is that Church, whoſe Faith they ought to follow.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> That our Adverſaries have no way of knowing the true Church.</head>
               <p>IT doth not appear therefore, who they are that truly belong to the Church. Yet ſuppoſe it is, and that all Baptized Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons outwardly profeſſing the true Faith, are Members of it; which Opinion moſt pleaſeth our Adverſaries, and is moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous for them. It is ſtill to be enquired, which, out of ſo many Societies that challenge to themſelves the name of the Church, juſtly and truly claims it. For not any one that firſt occurrs, is to be admitted and preferred before the reſt. But here, if any where, a diligent and accurate Examination is to be uſed; leſt inſtead of the Church of Chriſt, we follow the Synagogue of Satan; and for Divine Revelations receive exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Errors. This eſpecially becomes them, who when they have found the Church, give over any further enquiry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive without Examination all the dictates of it. They ought to be very vigilant and curious in the choice of their Guide; leſt if they haply miſtake, they incurr that Sentence of Chriſt, <hi>If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.</hi> Let us ſee therefore whether our Adverſaries can boaſt they have made a juſt and accurate enquiry herein, and moſt certainly found out the true Church.</p>
               <p>There are chiefly three Methods of making this Enquiry. 1. From the truth of the Doctrine profeſſed by any Church,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49773:75"/>and Conformity of that to the Word of God. 2. By Notes known only by the light of right Reaſon, and independently from the Word of God. 3. By Notes which are marked out and taught in the Scripture. <hi>Arriaga</hi> preferreth the firſt Method before all others. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> ſaith he<note n="1" place="margin">Reſpondeo veritatem doctrinae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bari etiam poſſe, non recurrendo ad Eccleſiam, imò ante primam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationem verae Eccleſiae debere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bari veritatem doctrinae. — Etenim cum Eccleſia, ut Eccleſia, definiatur per hoc, quòd ſit coetus profitentium veram doctrinam fidei, repugnat in terminis me ſupponere aliquam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationem eſſe veram Eccleſiam; niſi dicam eo ipſo ibi eſſe veram do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinam. Ergo non poſſum primò pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare veram doctrinam ex verâ Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiâ. <hi>Arr. de fide diſp. 7. Sect. 5.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>that the truth of the Doctrine may be proved without recurring to the Church; yea, and that before the firſt Proof of the true Church, the truth of the Doctrine ought to be proved.</hi> He proveth both parts of his Aſſertion largely, and in the ſecond part of it maketh uſe of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>For ſince the Church, as a Church, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the Congregation of men profeſſing the true Doctrine of Faith, it is a contradiction in the very terms, to ſuppoſe any Congregation to be the true Church, unleſs I do for that very reaſon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there is the true Doctrine.</hi> I cannot therefore firſt prove the Doctrine is true from the truth of the Church. To this we willingly ſubſcribe, and approve this Method of <hi>Arriaga</hi>'s only. Not ſo the reſt of our Adverſaries, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it, and labour to render it both infamous and impoſſible; pretending it to be full of inextricable difficulties, and not to be ſurmounted by the moſt learned, much leſs by illiterate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Wherefore I need not endeavour to prove that the true Church cannot be by this way known by our Adverſaries: They freely grant it, urge it, and labour to demonſtrate it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Method is uſed by many; who contend that the Church may be known independently from the Word of God by the help of Notes and Characters perceived by Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſuch as are Miracles, Sanctity, Antiquity, Amplitude, and the like. But they withal admoniſh that the Church cannot this way be known, as it hath annexed to it the Privilege of Infallibility by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as it is the certain Rule of Faith. They deny this can be any other way found out than by Faith relying on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Chriſt and the other teſtimonies of Scripture. But that the Authority, which theſe Notes conferr, is Humane, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and a Foundation only of humane and acquired, not of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49773:76"/>divine and infuſed Faith. So among infinite others teach <hi>Canus</hi>

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is abſurd to imagine that the Church of Chriſt, redeemed and governed by him, and animated by his Spirit, can be known by the ſole light of Nature without Revelation.

               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:49773:76"/>
               <p>But there are many things inconſiſtent to be found in it: As firſt, that it ſuppoſeth the Scripture to be acknowledged for the Word of God. For no man can believe the Notes of the Church laid down in the Scripture to be true and certain, till he be firſt perſwaded that all things contained in it are true and Divine. But how ſhall he, who hath not yet known the Church (for ſuch is he who enquires after it) be aſſured of the Divinity of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, if it be true what our Adverſaries ſo often inculcate, That the Scripture to us is of no Authority, till atteſted and confirmed by the Church? Thus a manifeſt Circle will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, Scripture received for the Authority of the Church, and the Church for the Authority of Scripture. Card. <hi>Richlieu</hi> confeſſeth this a great difficulty; but contendeth it may be ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſaying, The Church is known independently from the Scripture by the help of Notes, which Natural Reaſon ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth can agree to none but the true Church. But if the Church can be known before the Scripture, what need the Scripture be conſulted to find Notes whereby we may be brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Church? To what end theſe Labyrinths and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs toil to ſearch out a thing already known? Not to ſay, that this Method is coincident with the ſecond before mentioned, and is therefore for the ſame reaſons to be rejected. Beſides it manifeſtly contradicts our Adverſaries Hypotheſis concerning the obſcurity of Scripture. Every one knows how much they exaggerate this obſcurity, and <hi>Richlieu</hi> himſelf, within a few pages of this place, maintains it is obſcure, both as to the ſenſe, and as to the letter; and that not only to the Reprobate, but even the Elect; to the Faithful and Doctors themſelves. Who after all this can believe that he ſpeaks ſincerely and in earneſt, when he undertakes to demonſtrate out of this Book, ſo obſcure and impenetrable to the greateſt Wits, the Characters of the true Church, not to a Doctor or a Believer, but to an Infidel: For this he pretends, about his Converſion is the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute raiſed.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal therefore in that undertakes a moſt difficult matter. But the obſcurity of Scripture is not all the difficulty of this undertaking. For how ſhall it be demonſtrated thoſe things are by Scripture aſſigned for the Notes of the Church, of which Scripture is wholly ſilent, nay, teacheth the contrary to ſome of them; as might be evidently proved, if the intended
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49773:77"/>brevity of this Diſſertation would permit it? But ſuppoſe the Scripture attributes to the Church whatſoever our Adverſaries would have to be ſo many Notes of it: This avails not, unleſs it appear that thoſe Notes are not only true, but alſo the only Notes, and that no other is aſſigned in Scripture. This the Cardinal himſelf admoniſheth. <hi>It is to be obſerved,</hi> ſaith he<note n="16" place="margin">Method. liv. <hi>1.</hi> chap.</note>, <hi>that although it doth not follow that Society which hath one of the Notes of the true Church, is the true Church; yet it follows, that Society which wanteth one of theſe Notes, is not the true Church. Valentia</hi> had gone before him. <hi>Theſe are the Notes,</hi> ſaith he<note n="17" place="margin">Non ſunt notae Eccleſiae ſigil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latim ſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctim, quia fieri poſſit ut una harum &amp; altera aliis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniat. <hi>Val. Anal. fid. lib. 6. cap. 7.</hi>
                  </note>, <hi>which we urge, One, Holy, Catholick, Apoſtolick. Theſe are not the Notes of the Church ſingly, but conjunctly; becauſe it may be that one or two of them may agree to others.</hi> And indeed it cannot be denied that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church hath many of theſe Notes. If therefore from one or more of them we might argue affirmatively, the <hi>Greek</hi> muſt be granted to be a true Church.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore that the <hi>Roman,</hi> or any other, is the true Church, it is neceſſary that no note of the true Church be wanting to it, and that it be evident no other note is aſſigned in Scripture beſides thoſe wherein ſhe already glorieth. While this is uncertain, nothing can be ſecurely concluded from any Notes whatever. That an Infidel therefore be rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, it is required, that he read over the whole Scripture from one end to the other, accurately weigh and examine all places, that he may be aſcertained none of thoſe Notes have eſcaped his diligence. But this beſides, that it is long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and apt rather to diſcourage and deterr than allure an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel to the Chriſtian Religion, is impoſſible, if our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Doctrine of the obſcurity of Scripture be admitted. For who can promiſe himſelf that nothing hath eſcaped his moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious enquiry, amidſt ſo much darkneſs and intricacy, as our Adverſaries pretend to be in Scripture? Much leſs can an Infidel be aſſured of this, whoſe Underſtanding is yet clouded with Errors, and his Eyes with Blindneſs. Yet if he be not certain that no one Note of the Church is unknown to him, how many ſoever he hath by his ſearch obſerved, in vain doth he ſweat: ſince even, according to our Adverſaries, many Notes contribute nothing to that Society, to which any one is wanting. And this is ſo much the more difficult, becauſe our Adverſaries are not agreed about the number of the Notes. <hi>Valentia</hi> and many others
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49773:77"/>aſſign four, <hi>Driedo</hi> ſix, <hi>Medina</hi> ten, <hi>Sanders</hi> and <hi>Piſtorius</hi> twelve, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> fifteen, <hi>Boſius</hi> an hundred. In ſo great variety of opinions what certainty can be expected?</p>
               <p>But what if in this diligent reading of Scripture many things ſhall occurr, whereby the Catechumen will be induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are many other Notes beſide thoſe which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries point out, and thoſe ſuch as will divert him from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> He will in the firſt place obſerve thoſe words of Chriſt.<note n="18" place="margin">John VIII. 31, 47. X. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye continue in my Word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed. He that is of God, heareth God's words. My Sheep hear my voice.</hi> Hence he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the truth of Doctrine, and its conformity to God's word, is the moſt certain Note of the true Church. But our Adverſaries will never permit, that he ſhould make uſe of this Note to find out the Church. For that would introduce the firſt method ſo much hated by them: and it were to be feared, that the Catechumen comparing the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with the Scripture, would find a manifeſt repugnance in many things. Another Note of the Church he would find to be the obſervation of the Divine Precepts from the ſame places. For he cannot be ſaid to hear the voice of Chriſt, that obeys it not. And in other places Chriſt ſaith:<note n="19" place="margin">John VIII. 10, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye keep my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ye ſhall abide in my Love. Ye are my friends if ye do what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I command you.</hi> God alſo foretold by his Prophets that under the new Covenant he would write his Laws in the hearts of Men, and make them to walk in his ſtatutes. But can the Catechumen find this obſervation of the Divine precepts in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Cup is taken from the Laity, Prayers perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in an Unknown Tongue, and many other things uſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contrary to the Divine Commands?</p>
               <p>The Scripture oft-times calls the Church the moſt chaſt Spouſe of Chriſt. Now this Chaſtity conſiſts in keeping her Faith to God, and transferring no part of the Divine Worſhip due to him upon any other objects. Otherwiſe God will implead her of adultery, and give her a bill of divorcement. Will the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumen then from this Note conclude the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Spouſe of Chriſt; by whom he perceiveth ſo many Creatures, Saints deceaſed, their Reliques, the Croſs, Images, and the Hoſt, to be worſhipped and adored? Meekneſs and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs is alſo a note of the Church, when her Children are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49773:78"/>in the Scriptures called <hi>Sheep, Lambs, Doves, Turtles. Iſaiah</hi> foretold all cruelty ſhould be far from the Church of Chriſt.<note n="20" place="margin">Iſai. XI. 9. &amp; LXIII. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my Holy Mountain.</hi> Chriſt left his Peace to his Diſciples, and ſaid to them:<note n="21" place="margin">Matth. XI. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye ſhall find reſt unto your Souls.</hi> Who can then imagine the Church of Chriſt to be that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, which perſecutes all diſſenting from her with fire and ſword, and ſcarce uſeth any other arguments than Racks and Gibbets? Of the ſame nature, with this Note is another laid down by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> He calls<note n="22" place="margin">Pſ. CX. 3.</note> the Church <hi>a willing People:</hi> who are not retained in the Communion of their Saviour by force and fear, but by a moſt free and that moſt fervent Love. Hence her moſt excellent Paſtor is ſaid<note n="23" place="margin">Zach. XI. 7.</note> to govern her with <hi>two ſtaves, one called Beauty, and the other Bands:</hi> but that you may not miſtake, thoſe bands are<note n="1" place="margin">Hoſ. XI. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>the cords of a Man, and the bands of Love.</hi> Is <hi>Rome</hi> therefore this Church of Chriſt, which whereſoever ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, hath no ſtronger bands to retain her People than the deteſtable Tribunal of the Holy Inquiſition? To theſe two laſt Notes is conjoined a ſixth: That ſhe be free, and not a Servant of Men, eſpecially of Paſtors. This the Scripture teacheth in many places, particularly, <hi>Gal.</hi> IV. 25, 26. <hi>John</hi> VIII. 32.36. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> I. 24. III. 17. IV. 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> V. 3. <hi>Ja.</hi> I. 25. That therefore is not the Church of Chriſt, which ſerveth the Pope, whoſe Slave <hi>Cajetan</hi> expreſly calls her. Is that Church free, upon which the Pope impoſeth arbitrary Laws, which none muſt call in queſtion? Can he be denied to be Lord of the Church, who as the Canon Law<note n="2" place="margin">Decret part. 1. diſt. 40. can. <hi>Si Papa.</hi>
                  </note> tells us, <hi>although he ſhould carry innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable People by troups as Slaves to Hell, to be with himſelf for ever tormented; yet no mortal muſt preſume to reprehend his faults, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is to judge all, to be judged of none?</hi> Who, not to mention obſolete Stories, but lately commanded all to believe, there is five heretical propoſitions in <hi>Janſenius;</hi> and yet, although humbly intreated by many Doctors, would not declare in what part of <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Book they might be found? What is this but to account Chriſtians as moſt vile Slaves?</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Note of the Church conſiſts in this,<note n="3" place="margin">John IV. 23.</note> That ſhe worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth. The ancient Church of the Jews indeed uſed a groſs and ſenſible kind of Worſhip, and was employed about the mean and beggerly Elements of the World: but it is the peculiar glory of the Chriſtian Church, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49773:78"/>God in a way moſt conſentaneous to the ſimplicity of his being and the holineſs of his nature. Not ſo the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which obſerveth ſo many diverſe and difficult ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; that in compariſon of them the Moſaick Rites are both few and eaſy. This you will ſoon acknowledge, if you compare the fourth or at moſt the third part of the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch (for no more is taken up with ritual matters) with ſo many vaſt volumes, the Ceremonial, Pontifical, Ritual, Miſſal, Gradual, and others; which preſcribe the external part of the Roman Service. Laſtly, the true Church is that which neither uſurpeth nor diſturbeth the civil Government. Therein imitating Chriſt her Maſter; who offered heavenly things to all, earthly to none; profeſſed his Kingdom was not of this World; withdrew himſelf unto the Mountains, when ſought for by the multitude to be made a King; and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be a Judge in a matter of inheritance. The true Church obſerveth the Apoſtles precept<note n="4" place="margin">Rom. XIII. 1.</note> of being <hi>ſubject to the higher Powers:</hi> And that other<note n="5" place="margin">Ibid. v. 7.</note> of <hi>rendering to all their due, tribute to whom tribute, cuſtom to whom cuſtom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.</hi> Not ſo the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Head, the Pope, depoſeth Kings at his pleaſure, abſolveth their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their Oath of Allegiance, and pretends to a Sovereign Dominion over the whole World. I might produce many other like Notes of the Church out of Scripture; but theſe ſuffice to ſhew how great danger they expoſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to, who out of thoſe Holy Writings permit a judgment to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of her Truth and Purity.</p>
               <p>I will now proceed briefly to demonſtrate that not even from thoſe Notes which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſigns, can it be known that ſhe is the true Church. Card. <hi>Richlieu</hi> aſſigns four, Antiquity, Amplitude, Perpetuity, and Succeſſion. Amplitude ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered afterwards; the other three I will now briefly touch. Antiquity conſiſts ſolely or chiefly in this, that the Church which is called Ancient, have preſerved the ſame Faith, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Religion from the beginning. While the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> therefore glorieth in Antiquity, ſhe meaneth that ſhe now profeſſeth the ſame Faith which Chriſt formerly inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and his Apoſtles taught. But to know this there is no other way than to compare the preſent Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with the Ancient Monuments of Chriſtian Religion,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49773:79"/>of which Scripture is the Chief. Now this in nothing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from the firſt method, which we only approve, and our Adverſaries reject. If then the Church cannot be known by that method, neither can it by that which our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries propoſe. The diſcuſſion of perpetuity is yet more difficult. For therein is to be proved not only that the preſent is the ſame with the firſt and original Doctrine, but alſo that it was ſo in every Age, and that this profeſſion of the old Religion was never once interrupted. Now how vaſt and unexhauſted a knowledge of antiquity doth this require? No ancient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument muſt be neglected; infinite Volumes both Printed and Manuſcript muſt be read through. This few Men can attend to; or if they could, one Age would not ſuffice. Yet this accordding to <hi>Richlieu's</hi> method muſt be done by any Infidel who is a Candidate of Chriſtianity. The ſame may be ſaid of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. That is twofold, of Doctrine, and of Perſons. The firſt is coincident with antiquity and perpetuity: the ſecond in <hi>Gretſer's</hi> judgment is of little moment. <hi>Without Truth of Doctrine,</hi> ſaith he,<note n="6" place="margin">Sine veritate doctrinae ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio Paſtorum eſt exigui pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deris. <hi>De verb. Dei lib. 4. cap. 9.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Succeſſion of Paſtors is of ſmall weight.</hi> But ſuppoſe it of the greateſt moment. What is more laborious and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, to ſay no more, than to prove that in a long ſeries of Succeſſion continued through XVI. Ages there never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the leaſt interruption.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Notes ſingly. As for all taken together, it is manifeſt that even in our Adverſaries opinion they cannot be certain; ſince they are found in the Greek Church. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal denies that of Antiquity, becauſe the Church of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> cannot demonſtrate her claim of being founded by St. <hi>Andrew.</hi> Let it be. Certainly the Churches of <hi>Hieruſalem, Antioch, Epheſus, Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> which are parts of the Greek Church, were founded by Apoſtles, and the firſt even by Chriſt himſelf. Again the Cardinal denieth the Succeſſion of the Greek Biſhops; becauſe their Patriarchs were heretical. But firſt, it matters not what the Patriarchs are, if the other Biſhops be Orthodox. Secondly, this very thing may be brought againſt the Succeſſion of Popes: for ſome of them have been condemned by General Councils. Laſtly, if hereſie interrupts ſucceſſion; it will be no more certain that the Succeſſion of Popes was never interrupted, than that no Pope was ever an Heretick. But how ſhall this be aſcertained, eſpecially to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49773:79"/>of whom we now treat, who may conſider that many in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> openly teach the contrary? To this may be added, That it is abſurd in this caſe to pretend Hereſy againſt the Succeſſion of any Church. For that is the very thing now inquired by this Infidel, which Society of Chriſtians is the true Church, and conſequently, which of them are Hereticks or Schiſmaticks? This method therefore, can never certainly teach us, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Church.</p>

               <p>IF after all this we ſhould grant, That our Adverſaries may certainly know which is the true Church; it were yet to be inquired what this Church believeth.

               </p>
               <p>Many Divines, and thoſe of great name, (whoſe words we before produced) have gone farther, and maintained, That the true Faith, and true Church may be reduced to one only Woman. Nor doth <hi>John Viguerius</hi> a <hi>Dominican,</hi> Profeſſor of Divinity in the Univerſity of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> differ much from them, teaching that Faith, at leaſt explicit, may be preſerved in one perſon, all the reſt retaining only implicit Faith. <hi>It may be ſaid of the Church,</hi> ſaith he<note n="6" place="margin">Sic poteſt dici de Eccleſiâ, quòd poteſt ſervari in uno, prout dicitur de Mariâ Virg. quòd in eâ ſolâ in triduo ſepulturae manſit fides expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cita de divinitate Chriſti; quamvis multi alii per Judaeam exiſtentes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere poſſent fidem catholicam actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem &amp; implicitam, non tamen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitam, de divinitate Chriſti. <hi>Vig.

                  </note>, <hi>that it may be preſerved in one perſon, as it is ſaid of the V.</hi> Mary, <hi>that in her only, during the three days of burial, remained explicit Faith, touching the Divinity of Chriſt; although many others in</hi> Judea <hi>might have actual and implicit Catholick Faith, but not explicit, of the Divinity of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If either of theſe two Opinions be allowed, we muſt deſpair of ever knowing the Faith of the Univerſal Church. For where can be ſought for, by what Notes can be found that Phoenix, that <hi>Deucalion</hi> of the Chriſtian World, who alone retains ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith, when all the reſt have either erred, or preſerved only implicit Faith? But be theſe Opinions true or falſe; the oppoſite of neither of them can be of Faith, as I before proved of the former; and of the latter may be hence proved, That this Book of <hi>Viguerius</hi> is approved by the Faculty of Divinity of <hi>Paris;</hi> which would never have been done, if it had been found to contain Hereſie. However, let both be exploded, the other cannot be denied, That the greater part of the Church may err. Nay further, None ever yet dared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49773:80"/>how great that part of the Church muſt neceſſarily be, which cannot be infected with Error, without the ruin of the Infallibility of the whole. Unleſs therefore it appears, that the whole Church conſenteth, the belief of it cannot be a ſure Foundation for our Faith.</p>
               <p>But firſt, the whole Church ſeldom or never conſenteth. Certainly never in all things. All things therefore can never be learned from her. Whence then ſhall they be learned? Beſides, where ſhe doth conſent, it is ſo obſcure, that it can be known by no Man. This is proved, and much more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, by all thoſe Arguments which we brought againſt the certainty of knowing what all the Paſtors teach. For if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known what all the Paſtors teach; much leſs can it be known what all the Faithful believe; ſince there are far more Believers than Paſtors, and theſe teach more diſtinctly than the others believe. Beſide, it is not ſufficient to know what ſeemeth true to all the Faithful, unleſs it be alſo known what they all embrace as revealed by God. For our Adverſaries ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge there are many falſe Opinions of the whole Church. <hi>Maldonat</hi>
                  <note n="7" place="margin">A pud Richer Hiſt. Concil. lib. 3. cap. 3.</note> proveth this at large, and giveth ſome Examples of it. As, that the Church for many Ages uſed a Preface upon the Feſtival of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> wherein ſhe extolled his pure Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, although St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in ſeveral places confeſſeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for which reaſon the Preface was at laſt expunged; That for 600 years ſhe adminiſtred the Euchariſt to Infants; That ſhe worſhippeth particular Reliques of Saints, and prayeth for the Souls of particular Men in Purgatory, although it be not of Faith that thoſe Reliques are true, or theſe Souls in Purgatory, and the like; which proveth the neceſſity of knowing, not only what is held by the Univerſal Church, but whether it is held by her as of Faith, and revealed by God. But who ſhall aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this? For the common ſort of Believers are not wont ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately to diſtinguiſh theſe things; ſo that if any one ſhould ask whomſoever he meets, What they admit as true, what as reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what they receive with Divine Faith, what with Catholick Opinion; he would find very few who could comprehend the Sence of his Queſtion; much fewer, who could anſwer him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly. So far ſhall we be therefore from knowing by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod what is believed in the Univerſal Church, that it can ſcarce be known what is believed in any ſingle Dioceſs.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> That it may juſtly be doubted, whether all thoſe things be true, which the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church believeth.</head>
               <p>THere remains the third Reaſon of the impoſſibility of founding the Faith of all ſingle Chriſtians upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Univerſal Church, the uncertainty of the truth of this Belief. For, ſuppoſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Church, and that it is ſufficiently known what ſhe believeth: It is not yet manifeſt whether ſhe believeth rightly. For a True Church is one thing, an Infallible Church another: Yet Infallible muſt that neceſſarily be, which is to us a certain Rule of Faith. Before all things therefore it is required to be known, that the Church is Infallible. But how ſhall this be known? Our Adverſaries commonly ſay, It is known by Faith. But to this I oppoſe the Opinion of thoſe Divines, who hold, That all Chriſtians may fall from the Faith, except one ſingle Woman. Hence I conclude, That the Infallibility of the Church cannot be of Faith, becauſe repugnant to the Opinion of theſe Catholick Divines. Certainly we, who deny the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church, go not ſo far as they. We believe that God preſerveth to himſelf even in the moſt difficult times, <hi>a remnant according to the election of Grace:</hi> and that there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remains at leaſt an Inviſible Church, whoſe name being collective, cannot conſiſt, and be reſtrained to one perſon.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſaries therefore cannot pretend their Opinion, as it is at this day propoſed, to be of Faith: And ſo much the leſs, becauſe they can aſſign no Foundation of this Faith. Not Scripture, Tradition, Decrees of Popes, Definitions of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, or Conſent of Paſtors. For firſt, I have proved in the preceding Diſcourſe, That none of all theſe can be rely'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at leaſt according to our Adverſaries Hypotheſes; and then it is the conſtant Doctrine of Papiſts, That the Church is not believed for them, but they for the Church. Again it is certain, that the Infallibility of the Church cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieved
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49773:81"/>for the Authority of the Church it ſelf. For that would be a manifeſt Circle; and he that doubteth whether the Church can err, doth for that very reaſon doubt whether ſhe doth not err, when ſhe thinks that ſhe cannot err. Therefore <hi>Bannes</hi>
                  <note n="1" place="margin">Non poteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duci ad autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem ipſius Eccleſiae hoc e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim eſſet idem per idem confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare. <hi>Bann. in 2. 2. qu. 1. art. 1. dub. 4.</hi>
                  </note> ſaid truly, <hi>That the Church is the Infallible rule of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and explaining truths of Faith cannot be reduced to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church it ſelf; for that would be to prove the ſame thing by it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why then is it believed? Our Adverſaries commonly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That it is a thing before all others to be believed, and not for any other Rule; for then the ſame Queſtion would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn about that Rule: And becauſe they commonly require three things to make up an Act of Faith. 1. The Teſtimony of God revealing, as the formal Reaſon and principal Foundation. 2. A Rule whereby this Revelation of God may be manifeſted. 3. Motives of Credibility which may induce us to be willing to believe; they think the firſt is here preſent, and the third abundantly to be had in the Notes of the Church, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and dictated by Natural Reaſon; but the ſecond want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which they pretend not to be neceſſary in a matter of firſt belief, ſuch as this is. But firſt, if a Rule be not requir'd in forming this firſt Act of Faith: Why is it neceſſary in others? Why may not all the other Articles be believed for the Authority of God by the inducement of Motives of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, with which the Chriſtian Religion is abundantly furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Secondly, Which is chiefly to be regarded, it is abſurd to boaſt of a Teſtimony of God revealing, which no way can be known. The Infallibility of the Church, or any other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Belief can never be proved to have been revealed by God, but by ſome Rule either living or dead, whereby things revealed may be diſtinguiſhed from not revealed; otherwiſe the moſt fooliſh Opinion may intitle it ſelf to Revelation, and then cannot be rejected.</p>
               <p>Here they fly to Motives of Credibility, and by them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſupply their defect of a Rule, and manifeſt the Revelation. But if theſe Motives can confer upon the Church ſo ſufficient an Authority, that what ſhe propoſeth as revealed by God, muſt be believed: Why may not the like Motives give the ſame Authority to the Scripture, and aſſure us of the Divine Original of it? And that ſuch Motives are not wanting
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49773:82"/>to the Scripture. <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
                  <note n="2" place="margin">1 <hi>De verbo Dei,</hi> ib. 1. cap. 2.</note>, <hi>Suarez</hi>
                  <note n="3" place="margin">De fide diſp. 5. Sect. 2, 3.</note>, <hi>Duvall</hi>

                  <note n="5" place="margin">De fide diſp. 7. Sect. 1.</note> among many others expreſly confeſs. Why may we not then by theſe Motives firſt be ſatisfied of the Authority of Scripture, and from thence learn all things neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are clearly contained in it; and be ſo ſaved without recurring to the Church?</p>
               <p>Further, How is it gathered from theſe Notes and Motives of Credibility that the Church cannot err; whether evidently, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and neceſſarily; or only obſcurely, probably, and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently? The firſt our Adverſaries will never ſay; for then it would neceſſarily follow, That Faith is evident; which they all contend to be falſe; inſomuch as <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
                  <note n="6" place="margin">Ante approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem Eccleſiae non eſt evidens aut certum cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudine fidei de ullo miraculo quòd ſit verum mir aculum. Et quidem quòd non ſit evidens patet, quia tunc fides eſſet evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. <hi>Bell. de Eccleſ. l. 4. c. 14.</hi>
                  </note> diſputing of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the chief of theſe Motives, hath theſe words, <hi>Before the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Church it is not evident nor certain with the certainty of Faith of any Miracle, that it is a true one. And that it is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is manifeſt; for then Faith would be evident.</hi> Beſides, if theſe Notes evidently prove the Church cannot err, it would be moſt falſe, what our Adverſaries before delivered with ſo great conſent, that by theſe Notes the Church is not known as it hath an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but only as it hath an Humane and Fallible Authority. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, They acknowledge, as we before ſhewed, That a manifeſt and convictive Argument cannot be deduced from one or more of theſe Notes, although fortified by the Authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, if any one be wanting. How then will they afford evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when perceived by the ſole light of Nature, and are much fewer? For they allow more Notes to be pointed out by Scripture, than taught by the light of Nature.</p>
               <p>Do theſe Notes then only perſwade probably? If ſo, I have gained what I was to prove. For then it will be only probable that the Church cannot err; and the Faith of Papiſts will have no certainty, as not exceeding probability. For whatſoever they believe, they believe either for the Teſtimony or for the Judgment of the Church; and ſo cannot be more certain, or evident than is the Infallibility of the Church in teſtifying and judging. Some to elude this, make a twofold evidence, <hi>Phyſical</hi> and <hi>Moral;</hi> and grant the Arguments of the Infallibility of the Church not to be Phyſically evident, but contend they are Morally. So eſpecially <hi>Aegidius Conink</hi>
                  <note n="7" place="margin">De actib. ſup. diſp. 2. dub. 2. num. 46. col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. cum dub. 3. num. 71, 72.</note>. But here in the firſt place, this manifeſt abſurdity occurrs; That when they acknowledge theſe Arguments to be only Morally certain, they yet maintain Faith,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49773:82"/>which is founded ſolely upon them, to be Phyſically certain; for that degree of certainty all attribute to Divine Faith. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it hence alſo appears, that this Moral Certainty doth not ſuffice; becauſe it is more than Morally, even Phyſically evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that thoſe things are falſe, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth about the Euchariſt: For that the Euchariſt after Conſecration is ſtill Bread and Wine, is proved by innumerable Arguments of Phyſical Evidence, which conſequently can never be counterweighed, much leſs out weighed by Arguments of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evidence, brought to prove the Infallibility of that Church which teacheth a contrary Opinion.</p>
               <p>However it will not be amiſs to examine, whether the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from theſe Notes of the Church be morally evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as is pretended. But firſt we muſt remove the Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which lieth hid in this term. For it is uſed by the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in a threefold Sence. Firſt therefore, many call that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Certain, which is ſo probable, that many Arguments per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade it, but nothing inſinuates the leaſt ſuſpicion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Secondly, Thoſe things are called Morally Certain; which to uſe <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s words, are confirmed by ſo many Signs and Conjectures, as may exclude all Anxiety, but not all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt. Thirdly, Thoſe things are moſt properly ſaid to be morally certain, <hi>which are known by the common and unanimous te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of a great multitude witneſſing a thing by them ſeen, which Teſtimony none contradicts;</hi> as <hi>Conink</hi>
                  <note n="8" place="margin">Quae ex com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni &amp; concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di magnae mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinis rem viſam teſtantis teſtimonio, cui nemo contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, noſcuntur. <hi>De actib. ſup. diſp. 11. dub. 1. num. 44.</hi>
                  </note> defines them. If our Adverſaries ſay the Arguments take from the Notes of the Church are morally certain in the firſt or ſecond Sence; in the firſt place I deny it: For thoſe things only are morally certain in thoſe Sences, againſt which no contrary Arguments can be produced. For if any ſuch occurr, the Mind fluctuates, and can obtain no certainty. Now none can deny, that there are many at leaſt probable Arguments which perſwade, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Church. Secondly, I aſſert, That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Certainties will ſuffice. For they cannot, but in a looſe and improper Sence, be called Certainty. They are indeed meer probability, which may ſuffice in matters of Life and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where greater certainty cannot be had, but not in matters of Belief and Salvation, where the greateſt is required; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as theſe may poſſibly be falſe, as is manifeſt in the Caſes of an Infant whether Baptized, or an Hoſt whether Conſecrated,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49773:83"/>which are commonly produced for Examples of the firſt and greateſt of the two kinds of Moral Certainty. For both the Baptiſm of an Infant, and the Conſecration of an Hoſt, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Intention of the Prieſt, can never be certainly known to have been duly performed. For no Man can be ever ſpeculatively certain of thoſe things which can be falſe.</p>
               <p>There remains then the third Sence; which I deny not to be ſufficient, although it be not wholly conſonant to the Doctrine of our Adverſaries. But to paſs by that, it is manifeſt, That here is no place for this kind of certainty; ſince it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Teſtimony of others ſo framed and circumſtantiated, that it is altogether, at leaſt morally impoſſible to deceive, or be deceived; as that <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> formerly exiſted, as <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> do now; whereas Arguments drawn from Antiquity, Amplitude, Sanctity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are of another kind, as being wholly artificial, and conſequently moſt different from thoſe which beget this Moral Certainty. Beſides, there is none of theſe Notes, wherein the <hi>Greek</hi> Church may not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory with the <hi>Latin.</hi> Sanctity, Amplitude, Antiquity, and conſtancy of Martyrs none can deny to her. As for Miracles, the <hi>Greeks</hi> by the confeſſion of the <hi>Latins</hi> have ſomewhat admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which is not to be found in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. For <hi>Lupus</hi>
                  <note n="9" place="margin">In Concil. tom. 5. p. 543.</note> relates out of <hi>Chr. Angelus</hi> and <hi>Leo Allatius,</hi> that it is at this day moſt frequent among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Excommunicate Perſons immediately after death, grow black, ſwell, and become very hard, nor can be diſſolved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Biſhop gives them Abſolution, which being once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, they are reduced into Duſt: <hi>The Divine Goodneſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>Lupus, by theſe</hi>
                  <note n="10" place="margin">Captivos ſub Turcicâ tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Chriſtianos divina bonitas conſolatur per talia miracula &amp; in Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>câ fide confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat.</note> 
                  <hi>Miracles comforting and confirming in the Faith, the poor Chriſtians oppreſſed with the</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Tyranny.</hi> In this Miracle four things may be obſerved. 1. That it is not only boaſted by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but alſo acknowledged by the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins.</hi> 2. That it is an ordinary, and almoſt daily Miracle. 3. That it is annexed to the Epiſcopal Dignity, ſo as their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication and Abſolution hath a ſenſible and ſupernatural effect. 4. That it ſerveth not only to favour the Chriſtian Religion profeſſed by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but alſo their private error. For as <hi>Lupus</hi> obſerveth, They imagine the Abſolution given after death to be valid, and to deliver from the Torments of Hell it ſelf; which ſeemeth to be confirmed by the ſenſible
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49773:83"/>effect that immediately follows the Abſolution. What have the <hi>Latins</hi> like to this? Their pretended Miracles are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by their Adverſaries, but rather convinced of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity by them, and even by many of their own Communion; they are rare, not ordinary, nor annexed to any Eccleſiaſtical Dignity; and ſuch as, if they were true, ſerve to confirm on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Chriſtian Religion in general, not their own particular Tenets.</p>
               <p>It is manifeſt therefore, That thoſe Arguments are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which are deduced from the Notes of the Church; ſince, if they were ſo, they would demonſtrate, what our Adverſaries think to be falſe, That the <hi>Greek</hi> is the True and Infallible Church. This might be evidently evinced, if we conſidered each Note ſingly. But beſides that it is already accurately performed by our Reverend B. <hi>Morton. Jo. Gerardus</hi> and others, it ſeems not very neceſſary in this place. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I finiſh, and in one word conclude, That the Papiſts, who boaſt of having ſo many immovable Foundations of their Faith, have not ſo much as one which is ſolid; and that what they believe, they do it pertinaciouſly indeed, but neither cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly nor firmly.</p>
